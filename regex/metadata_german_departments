Abstract: This dissertation explores the memory of postwar German-speaking refugees in Austria through an analysis of diverse media, cultural practices, and their reception. Part I of the dissertation examines postwar memorials and their reception in newspapers, as well as the role of pilgrimage, religious ritual, and public responses of defacement. Part II focuses on post-Waldheim literature and its reception, specifically examining the literary genres of novels and travelogues describing German-speaking refugees’ trips to their former homes. In examining these memorials and literature as well as their reception, I show how static and marginalized the memory of German-speaking refugees has remained throughout the history of the Second Republic, even after the fragmentation of Austrian memory in the wake of the Waldheim affair. While Chapter 1 posits four reasons for this marginalization, the continuance of this marginalization into the present can be summed up by drawing on Oliver Marchart’s concept of historical-political memory and by pointing to the politicization and tabooization of the memory as a far-right discourse. Identifying a gap between the vast cultural memory of German-speaking refugees on the one hand, and the dearth of scholarship dealing with the subject on the other, I argue that it is time for these memories to be taken seriously and not be dismissed as uncritical or otherwise problematic representations of the past. At the same time, however, they cannot be accepted as-is without placing them in the proper historical context. Consequently, an analysis of narrative strategies and the role of memory in making the past present is timely and important.

Helping Language Learners Align with Readers Through Narrative: Insights into the Breadth, Targets, and Explicitness of Evaluation from Appraisal Studies of Second Language German Writers

Abstract: Language users never communicate in a vacuum. Successful meaning-making through language depends on an awareness of one’s presumed audience and the choice of linguistic tokens appropriate to that interaction. In their engagement with that presumed audience, literate language users are characterized by their ability to express individuality, offer explicit and implicit opinions, assert affiliation with their readers, persuade their readers, and reinforce or challenge socially valued concepts.
In Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), these uses of language fall under the interpersonal metafunction, which encompasses the goal of the action performed by the language user and their relationship with an intended audience (Eggins, 2004; Halliday, 1984). One key component of interpersonal meaning making is evaluative language, described within the context of SFL by the APPRAISAL system (Martin & White, 2005), which operates at the level of discourse semantics and facilitates analysis of evaluation patterns beyond the word or sentence level (Coffin, 2002).
Current L2 writing research on interpersonal meaning making is characterized by a lack of studies examining (a) genres outside of academic writing and (b) languages other than English. To expand instructors’ awareness of (a) students’ command of interpersonal resources at various curricular levels and (b) instructional activities that can foster students’ continued development, this project explores the use of evaluative language in narrative texts written by L2 learners of German at three proficiency levels.
This project consisted of two rounds of data collection. In the first study, fairy tales written by a small group of students of varying proficiency levels were analyzed in detail; potential patterns in APPRAISAL were flagged for further analysis. In the second study, a larger set of texts were analyzed to assess whether patterns emerging from the first study achieved statistical significance. Results revealed trends in the use of APPRAISAL types across the various levels, with lower proficiency writers relying more heavily on APPRECIATION and narrator-centered evaluations, whereas higher proficiency writers drew more often on AFFECT as a vehicle for implicit evaluation and broadened the scope of their evaluations to include valued behaviors and traits. The thesis concludes with potential instructional activities and remarks on the applicability of the current APPRAISAL scheme to narrative analysis.

Wie Bauen? Eine Kritische Auseinandersetzung Mit Der Architektur Der Unmittelbaren Nachkriegszeit in Film, Radio Und Zeitschrift

Abstract: My thesis examines media representations of architecture in the immediate decade after World War II, with a particular focus on 1947–49. In this time of a construction crisis, architecture was “relocated” to different media like radio plays, architectural magazines or city image films. A climate evidencing a „Baukultur der Bewusstlosigkeit“ was diagnosed for this decade in the discourse of the 1960s. Against this backdrop, I examine three works—“The Fifth Dream” („Der fünfte Traum“) of Günter Eich’s radio play Träume (Dreams, 1951), the short-lived architectural magazine BAU. Zeitschrift für wohnen, arbeiten, sich erholen (Magazine for Living, Working, Relaxing, 1947) and the short city image film Stein auf Stein. Ein Land baut auf (Stone on Stone. Building a Country, 1949)—to see how these worked through the various discourses of the time in regards to construction and building a new future. Looking at new material that has not yet been examined, I seek out works that are in some way experiments at the margins—textual miniatures and short forms. Although the three works I have chosen are ephemeral works, they are the most conclusive on many topics that occur in the immediate postwar decade: they shed light on new media constellations, changing gender norms, the discourse of “coming to terms” with the past as well as the biographical, historical/political and cultural continuities with National Socialism. They also give us insight into democratization and occupation politics. One sees the effort to think through what new technology means in the early post-war decade. I also elaborate on moments of excess and transgression in these works, which emerge from a time of licensing policy changes, paper shortages and so on.

Imagined Social Spaces: Stereotypical Attributions that Do and Do Not Travel from Native Speakers to Teachers of German
Author: Rothe, Lucian
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27832395.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This study investigated (1) what kinds of stereotypes about male and female native speakers (NS), as well as male and female NS and non-native-speaker (NNS) teachers of German, 67 first-semester learners of German at a large Midwestern research university had heard. It also explored (2) what these accounts reveal about how stereotypical attributions to target-language members in global contexts, i.e., NSs of German, travel to members of learners’ immediate target-language environments, i.e., the teacher. The study was grounded in motivational frameworks of foreign-language learning put forth by Norton and Dörnyei. The stereotypical notions described by respondents were sorted into categories of stereotypes, using principles of Grounded Theory. Inferential statistical analyses compared the stereotype categories attributed to the respective groups of NSs and teachers. Results showed that (1) respondents were well aware of an array of stereotypes about NS as well as teachers of German and (2) these stereotypical notions traveled via two pathways of association from NSs to teachers, i.e., either via birth, as for NS teachers, or via self-affiliation with the target-language community, as for NNS teachers. What is more, stereotypical notions revealed a link between perceived qualities of the language and its speakers. Gender was a factor that mattered with respect to NSs, including teachers, but not NNS teachers. Findings suggest that teachers—regardless of NS status and gender—are regarded to be affective gateways to the target community and representatives of NSs in the language classroom. Results also speak to the potential that stereotypical notions of NSs may apply to individuals who decide to associate with the community of German speakers. The idea that speaking and learning a specific language bestows specific other, personal characteristics contains attractive as well as repulsive potential when students select a language for study. Results call for closer investigations of (1) the stereotypes’ accuracy according to learners of German, as well as of (2) stereotypical notions held by learners of other foreign languages and (3) by NS and NNS teachers of German and other languages. Implications for teaching address learners as cross-cultural mediators and members of a local community of foreign-language speakers.

Liberating Laughter. Dramatic Satire and the German Public Sphere, 1790-1848
Author: Hertel, Jeffrey Alden
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27830011.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: One of the most far-reaching consequences of the French Revolution was the spread of political debate. Across Europe, people of all sorts — not just princes, but peasants and peddlers as well— started talking politics. When, in the face of this, the princes of the German states censored traditional modes of public discourse including newspapers other print media, the burden of socio-critical discourse fell to an unlikely place: ridiculing entertainment in the form of satire and, more specifically, satiric theater. Not a place of reasoned discourse seeking the expression of consensus, satire attacks and ridicules its object, making it a fitting forum for the dawn of partisan politics.
This dissertation traces the historical and cultural conditions peculiar to German dramatic satire between 1790 and 1848 as it compensated for a lack of political debate elsewhere. Looking at how satire in the public space of the theater became one of the premier channels of political debate in an age of revolutionary change and heavy-handed censorship, the work chronologically surveys the most important satiric dramas of the era, including works by August von Kotzebue, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph von Eichendorff, Christian Dietrich Grabbe, Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer, Johann Nestroy, Georg Büchner, and Karl Gutzkow. Through careful explication of the sociopolitical crises in which dramatic satirists intervened, we see how they tried to help the German people laugh their way to liberation.

<em>Wild Politics</em>: Political Imagination in German Romanticism
Author: Gill, John Thomas
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27832744.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The political discourse of German Romanticism is often interpreted reductively: as either entirely revolutionary, reactionary, or indeed apolitical in nature. Breaking with this critical tradition, this dissertation offers a new conceptual framework for political Romanticism called wild politics. I argue that Romantic wild politics generates a sense of possibility that calls into question pragmatic forms of implementing sociopolitical change; it envisions imaginative alternatives to the status quo that exceed the purview of conventional political thinking. Three major fields of the Romantic political imaginary organize this reading: affect, nature, and religion.
Chapter 1 examines Novalis’ politics of affect. In his theory of the fairy tale—as opposed to the actual fairy tales he writes—Novalis proposes a political paradigm centered on the aesthetic dimension of love. He imagines a new Prussian state constituted by emotional attachments between the citizen and the monarch.
Chapter 2 takes up the “new mythology” in the works of F.W.J. Schelling, Friedrich Schlegel, and Johann Wilhelm Ritter, the comprehensive project of reorienting modern life towards its most transformative potentials. Nature and the speculative natural sciences are identified as the most important resources for this task. Romantic new mythology calls for a utopian world of egalitarian social relations, a nation of scientist-poets discovering and practically applying the mysteries of the natural cosmos.
In an excursus, Chapter 3 turns to August Klingemann’s novel Nachtwachen (1804). Its critique of stereotypical Romantic practice—in terms of affect, nature, and religion—exposes the movement’s idealist excesses and isolation from sociopolitical reality. Policing the Romantic poet, but also disrupting police order, Nachtwachen’s nightwatchman figure embodies a Romanticism in descent, brought back down to earth and its material conditions.
Chapter 4 focuses on Friedrich Schlegel’s late works as he recasts Romantic wild politics as a religious program. Drawing on contemporary esoteric concepts and practices of the spiritual body, in the 1820s Schlegel relies on an apocalyptic standpoint to reject the legitimacy of post-revolutionary political order. At the end of the Romantic movement, he prophesizes the divine revolution to come, and investigates the imaginative subjects and communities that would accelerate its approach.

Disruptive Organizers: Wild Children in German Realism (1850-1900)
Author: Reif, Margaret Suzanne Hamilton
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27831754.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation explores the intersection of childhood and wildness within the literary movement of German realism. The latter half of the nineteenth century saw the introduction of mandatory education and the consolidation of the middle-class family, both of which established childhood as a distinct phase. The literary movement of German realism emerged at the same time, with a focus on representing ordinary life and experiences with a particular concentration on bourgeois values and norms.. But many children in the works of this movement prove more fantastical than realistic, more extraordinary than ordinary, and more deviant than safely bourgeois. This study therefore examines how representations of wild children interact with the aesthetics of the average within German realism. Ultimately, this dissertation has two main points: First, depictions of wild children should not be read solely as a means of celebrating the average, middle class reality of the nineteenth-century through a strategy of the literary containment of wild children. Rather, the wild child initiates a redemptive transformation of reality and is a means for introducing that which would otherwise escape representation in realist prose fiction. Second, the frequent appearance of wild children within the literary movement of German realism serves as a rhetorical strategy to depict a changing nineteenth-century reality with regard to education, family, gender, nation and art, as well as a means to question the success of these structures. In order to make these arguments, this dissertation engages with four types of wild children: literary descendants of Goethe’s Mignon, fairytale children, differently-abled children associated with the figure of Kaspar Hauser, and criminal children. It also considers the intersection of gender and wildness and the ways in which the language of wildness, culture and civilization have been used in Western literary traditions, particularly in a late-nineteenth-century German context.

The <em>Heimatklänge</em> and the Danube Swabians in Milwaukee: A Model of Holistic Integration for a Displaced German Community
Author: Anderlé de Sylor, Julia
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27998712.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: For over 300 years, Danube Swabians were able to maintain their German dialect and culture despite their status as an ethnic minority in Hungary and Yugoslavia. The events after World War II, including expulsion from their homes and ethnic persecution, radically destabilized this minority’s conception of Heimat. Most were displaced from their home villages either eastward to Soviet labor camps or westward, as displaced persons, before many migrated to America. In Milwaukee, many Catholic Danube Swabians attended St. Michael’s parish, a German parish led by the Pallotine father and Schönstatt Movement founder, Father Joseph Kentenich. Kentenich and the pastoral staff developed the Heimatklänge (1962–1964) newsletters for their parishioners. As a whole, these German newsletters provide insight into the challenges and successes of an immigrant community in America.
This study seeks to define Structured Grounded Theory, which was informed by Charmaz Constructivist Grounded Theory (2006) and thematic analysis. GT has often drawn on interviews as its main source material; Structured GT was specifically developed to analyze historical texts, where follow-up interviews are not possible. While this method was used to examine newsletters for a German immigrant community in Milwaukee, it can be adapted by other researchers seeking to analyze historical texts and ethnic communities.
Much research has been conducted on PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and acculturative stress; this study addresses the two by redefining Heimat. Heimat is complex: this study proposes that it can be understood by the multi-dimensional connections formed by individuals and communities—a system of attachments. The newsletters discuss potential paths of adjustment and adaptation; paths that could result in potential loss of the parishioners’ linguistic, religious, material, scial, and cultural heritage. The findings of this study propose a Model of Holistic Integration: theoy identify the parishioners’ past trauma (Heimatlosigkeit) and their immigrant challenges (alte vs. neue Heimat) and seek innovative strategies to reconcile the two (Beheimatung). This model can serve as an assessment tool of other refugee communities: it identifies sources and implications of trauma and acculturative stress and provides a framework to develop strategies that will reconcile an immigrant’s past and present challenges.
Alternate Abstract: Vom 18. bis zum 20. Jahrhundert lebten die Donauschwaben als deutsche Minderheit in Gebieten des damaligen Habsburger Reiches. In Sprachinseln in Ungarn, Rumänien, und Jugoslawien erhielten die Dialektsprecher*innen über 250 Jahre hinweg ihre Sprache, Kultur und Konfession. Als im Jahre 1945 die Grenzen in Europa neugezogen wurden, wurden die Donauschwaben aus ihrem Siedlungsgebiet vertrieben und in sowjetische Arbeitslager oder in westeuropäische Flüchtlingslager geschickt. In der Nachkriegszeit in Europa sowie später in Milwaukee mussten sie mehrmals neu definieren, was sie unter Heimat verstanden.
Da Religion eine wichtige Rolle für sie in ihrer alten Heimat spielte, suchten die nach Milwaukee umgezogenen Donauschwaben eine deutsche Gemeinde. Geleitet vom Pallotiner und Schönstatt-Gründer Pater Kentenich, bot die St. Michaelkirche nicht nur deutsche Gottesdienste an, sondern entwickelte auch ein vielfältiges Programm für ihre Gemeinde, unter anderem das Rundschreiben Heimatklänge (1962-64).
Angelehnt an die konstruktivistische grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006) und basierend auf einer thematischen Analyse, erstellt die Arbeit eine neue qualitative Methode, die strukturierte Grounded Theory (GT). Verwendet klassische GT häufig Interviews oder Aufnahmen als Quelle, so wurde strukturierte GT entwickelt als „induktiv angelegter Forschungsprozess“, um eine Theorie auf der Grundlage eines historischen Textkorpus zu entwickeln (Meier & Pentzold). Dieses Verfahren, das entwickelt wurde, um Wochenblätter für eine Gemeinde deutscher Geflüchteter zu analysieren, könnte auch von qualitativen Wissenschaftler*innen verwendet werden, um andere Migrant*innengruppen zu betrachten.
Posttraumatische Belastungstörungen (PTSD) und Akkulturationsstress (acculturative stress) sind bereits mehrfach untersucht worden (z.B. Berry, 2006); diese Arbeit befasst sich mit beiden Themen, um eine neue Definition von Heimat zu erstellen. Der Begriff ist komplex: die Arbeit schlägt vor, dass Heimat durch vielschichtige Interaktionen entsteht—ein organisches Bindungssystem. Die Heimatklänge thematisieren den Zusammenhang zwischen Trauma, Assimilation, und den Herausforderungen der Migration, und beschäftigen sich mit dem drohenden Verlust des kulturellen, sozialen und religiösen Erbes der Donauschwaben. Die Ergebnisse der Arbeit legen ein Modell organischer Integration vor: sie identifizieren das Trauma der Heimatlosigkeit und Herausforderungen der Migration (alte vs. neue Heimat), und schlagen innovative Strategien vor, um über beide Themen aufzuklären (Beheimatung). Das Modell könnte als diagnostisches Hilfsmittel anderer Flüchtlingsgruppen geeignet werden, denn das Model bestimmt die Herkunft und Folgen vom Trauma und Akkulturationsstress und bietet ein Bezugssystem an, um neue und praktische Strategien zu entwickeln.

Biblical Operas and the Discourse of German-Jewish Difference, 1907-1959
Author: Nester, Adi

Abstract: This dissertation studies the role of biblical-themed operas and oratorios in articulating German-Jewish difference. It situates three seminal musical dramas and their literary sources within a politico-theological discourse of difference between Germans and German-Jews, which originated in eighteenth-century practices of interpreting and translating the Hebrew Bible. It focuses on the interaction between poetic and literary traditions, musical forms, and performance practices and shows how this exegetical discourse of difference was translated into the realm of modernist aesthetics by linking key modernist trends in the works to contemporaneous socio-political debates. The three chapters discuss Paul Ben-Haim’s oratorio Joram (1932) and its text by Rudolf Borchardt (1907), Arnold Schoenberg’s opera-fragment Moses und Aron (1932-51), and Eric Zeisl’s unfinished opera Hiob (1939-58) based on Joseph Roth’s novel (1930). Each chapter studies a musical-dramatic work in relation to a different socio-political question, from the contested notion of the unified nation, through the problem of political representation, to conceptions of organic integration and the nation-state. The project connects the perception of artworks as fragmentary in modernity with German culture’s need to define itself in relation to the Jewish minority that lived among it. Thereby, it complicates traditional notions of power distribution between majority and minority groups and reframes questions of assimilation, acculturation, and political difference.

Abstract: Mit der Untersuchung der Poetik der Abweichung widmet sich diese Dissertation der Analyse der Darstellung von Menschen mit Behinderung und ihrer Familien in der österreichischen und deutschen Literatur des 19. Jahrhunderts. Insgesamt werden dabei drei Ziele verfolgt: Erstens wird die Entwicklung der Repräsentation von Behinderung über mehr als ein halbes Jahrhundert nachgezeichnet und so ihre Diskursivität veranschaulicht. Zweitens wird mithilfe einschlägiger Theorien der Disability Studies das Verhältnis zwischen Behinderung und Familie, wie es die Literatur imaginiert, analysiert. Drittens wird auch die Rolle von Behinderung für die Texte selbst, ihre Struktur, ihren Aufbau, ihre Wirkungsweise, aber auch ihre poetologischen Programme festgehalten. Die Leitfragen sind dabei: Welche Rolle spielt Behinderung in und für die Texte in der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts? Und wie etabliert sich das Verhältnis zwischen Menschen mit Behinderung und ihren Familien sowie näheren Gemeinschaften in der Literatur?
Im Fokus stehen dabei ausgewählte Texte von Berthold Auerbach, Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, Adalbert Stifter und Theodor Storm, die gemeinsam mehr als ein halbes Jahrhundert umspannen und so einen guten Einblick in die Thematik geben. Die Texte beweisen: Die Darstellung von Behinderung ist ein fester Bestandteil der deutschsprachigen Literatur und ihre Analyse ermöglicht es, die Etablierung und auch die Unterminierung spezifischer Normen und Ideologien rund um Körper und Familie nachzuvollziehen. So wird es möglich, Textbotschaften zu entschlüsseln, die andernfalls unentdeckt bleiben würden und auch sehr kanonische und vielfach untersuchte Texte können aus dieser neuen Perspektive heraus gewinnbringend betrachtet werden.

Zeitschrift, Text und Bild. Der bürgerliche Realismus im Kontext der visuellen Massenmedien des 19. Jahrhunderts
Author: Barthold, Willi Wolfgang
Publication info: Georgetown University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27740867.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The dissertation focuses on German realist literature of the late nineteenth-century and its interplay with the visual and media culture of its time. While realist writers dedicated themselves to showing the “true essence” of reality, new theories of perception, processes of modernization, and technological innovations drastically challenged any stable models of representation and complicated notions of the “real”. As a result, realist texts developed new literary aesthetics that were shaped by their intermedial environment and explored modern mechanisms of discursive and medial reality construction through epistemological experiments. In addition to the increased societal prominence of photography and other technologies of image production, illustrated journals and magazines became omnipresent reading materials during this time and featured, among numerous text genres and illustrations, also realist novels and novellas. These texts therefore must be analyzed in their original, serialized mode of publication and within the context of an emerging popular culture of visual stimulation. This study thus asks how realist literature was shaped by its contextualization within illustrated journals as “mass media” and how it reacted to integration into this media culture with self-reflective, poetological, and epistemological discourses that explored changing notions of reality. With close-readings of works by Wilhelm Raabe, Theodor Fontane, Balduin Möllhausen, and Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, this research demonstrates that realist literature grappled with transforming ways of storytelling in an increasingly image-dominated society, the mechanisms of creating “truth” in mass media communication, as well as notions of gender and foreignness in a modernized and globalized media-cultural context. While doing so, the study also challenges the still prevailing high vs. low culture dichotomy in literary studies by investigating authors and texts that are not represented in the established, male-centered canon. This research bridges the gap between scholarly arguments that, on the one hand, focus on the importance of journals as publication media of realist texts and those that, on the other hand, focus on literary realism’s interplay with the visual, by suggesting that only a combination of methods from both fields can lead to a thorough understanding of the epistemological inquiries that shape these texts.

The Neuro-Poetics of Pain: Human Physiology in Haller and Lessing
Author: Berjan, Sandra
Publication info: Northwestern University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27668327.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation aims to redefine the concept of pain as it appears in literary studies and demonstrate how the new definition garners insight into the interwovenness of literature and physiology in the mid-eighteenth century. It challenges the claim that pain is opposed to language by adopting a new materialist concept of entanglement and insisting that pain, text, and nervous system do not pre-exist their interpenetration. After situating its argument within the greater context of pain research and debates around the nature-culture binary, this dissertation focuses on the poetic works and physiological experiments of Albrecht von Haller. Through a series of close readings, I demonstrate how Haller’s choices within his physiological experimental system respond to texts, and vice versa. I then proceed to elucidate how G. E. Lessing engages with Haller’s physiological system, both in his literary work and his theories on empathy and acting.
Liquidity is a central motif that emerges from these readings. I argue that the concept of the nerves as communicating via liquid informs the varied appearances of water imagery in the epoch of Empfindsamkeit. This argument finds evidence in both Haller’s poetry and Lessing’s play, Miss Sara Sampson. Haller’s vision of the Alpine society as an ideal utilizes the concept of a self-contained system of circulation. Lessing’s play is, significantly, considered to be the first bürgerliches Trauerspiel, and it adopts and transforms this circulatory imagery to suggest a destabilization of the natural-arbitrary binary. Far from a mere linguistic exercise, a rigorous examination of pain in texts and as a text leads to a new perspective on these canonical works and their inter-disciplinary relationship to each other.

Glückliche Enden. Aus der Geschichte der affirmativen Kunst
Author: Bunia, Anton J.
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2020. 27668990.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: In this dissertation I investigate the history of the modern happy ending. Drawing on a diverse set of historical sources from the early modern period until today, this study reconstructs and explores various conceptual origins and genealogical forerunners of the modern happy ending—notorious for its proliferation in Hollywood cinema—as a culturally as well as politically significant phenomenon.
The main and basic insight the study unveils is the deeply political nature of happy endings. According to a widespread misconception, happy endings are intrinsically reactionary and politically conservative. This study rectifies such notions by exploring the intricate role affirmative art has played in a diverse set of historical case studies. Through these case studies, my dissertation demonstrates that happy endings at times even display a subversive and progressive character. The history of happy endings, thus, sheds light on the cultural dimension of various political contexts and the telling interactions between political oppression and emancipation throughout the centuries. In happy endings, namely, affirmative art strives to articulate a societal vision of hope, harmony, or even bliss.
The most common misconception that this study refutes dismisses happy endings as trite and artless concessions to so-called popular taste. In this still prevalent view, the political implications happy endings entail are merely considered an epi-phenomenon of very recent ideas of entertainment. Throughout the early modern period, happy endings start out as occasional entertainment for the happy few but turn into many different religiously and politically altered reconfigurations addressed to ever larger audiences to live happily ever after. Finally, they lend themselves to the modern versions that still persist today and that operate on the mass-mediatic and concurrently democratic assumption of happy endings for all. Visions of societal harmony become stories of emancipation and inclusion.
The struggles for happy endings tell an important story about societal cohesion by allowing for a cultural assembly in which societies debate, impetuously and unremittingly, what they really want. By articulating a positive societal vision, texts regularly provoke protest and affirmation alike. This study provides a framework to analyze possible happy endings by contributing to the history and theory of democracy.

The Ghosts of Humanity in German and Austrian Literature and Film from 1900 to Today
Author: Mahan, William
Publication info: University of California, Davis, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 27663773.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This study traces a genealogy through German and Austrian literature and film from the onset of the twentieth century to the present day that conveys a haunting imposition of Europe’s violent history on its contemporary moment. The narratives and films from the onset of the 20th Century to the present day – especially those by Germans and Austrians, who seem to carry on their shoulders a painful awareness of the haunting violence left by European history – attest to this legacy of memory in both its voluntary and involuntary aspects. Both of these nations have histories of frequent governmental transition and various forms of state. I argue that the ghost comes to portray the ruptures in society that characterize the last century and a half of western, and more recently, globalized society, analyzing critical outlooks expressed in literary and filmic forms.

Generational Legacies in Family Life Narratives: Re-examining the Mother Figure as Nazi Sympathizer at the Millennial Turn
Author: Yœurp, Mélanie
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 27672357.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The millennial turn witnessed a spate of family narratives, whether in the form of prose texts (often called “family novels” or “generational novels”) or documentary films. In these stories, the narrators examine their families’ involvement with the Third Reich. They adopt a critical, yet empathetic tone, which attests to their growing historical and emotional distance to National Socialism.
This dissertation focuses on four of these narratives: Uwe Timm’s Am Beispiel meines Bruders (2003), Gisela Heidenreich’s Das endlose Jahr (2002), Alexandra Senfft’s Schweigen tut weh (2007), and Malte Ludin’s documentary film 2 oder 3 Dinge, die ich von ihm weiß (2005). The narrators all scrutinize how their (grand)mothers’ ambivalent behavior supported National Socialism. In this regard, these four stories exemplify a wider trend that literary scholars such as Katherine Stone (2017) and Simonetta Sanna (2017) and film scholar Ingrid Lewis (2017) observe: literature and cinema characterize women under National Socialism with increasingly ambiguous traits. Cultural productions thereby catch up with historiography, which emphasizes since the 1980s women’s diverse behaviors under the Third Reich, undoing a long-standing idea that this category of the population consisted either of innocent victims or cruel monsters.
However, I claim that these four narratives continue to downplay or ignore the (grand)mothers’ political agency. I here draw on feminist scholars in the field of international relations Caron E. Gentry and Laura Sjoberg (2015) and Linda Åhäll (2015) who identify a metanarrative that explains violence with reference to women’s nurturing and peaceful “nature”: women are violent either because their “natural” need to nurture pushes them to do so or because something went wrong with their “nature.” In both cases, women’s political motives are rarely mentioned. This dissertation demonstrates that the metanarrative is deployed in the four texts investigated here: the narrators tend to frame the (grand)mother as a subservient wife who followed her husband, a vulnerable single mother who did her best to protect her reputation, a loving wife who remained loyal until the bitter end, or, conversely, as a woman bereft of nurturing qualities.

Creative Destruction: The Financial Crisis and Cultural Production
Author: Kaipainen, Joel
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 27671702.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The Global Financial Crisis (2007ff) brought economic phenomena to the center of public attention. The following political shifts and shocks show that unleashed forces of creative destruction (Schumpeter) do more than annihilate economic values, but reach far into all areas of human action, valuation and sense making. In tandem with conflicting scholarly explications and policy suggestions, a wealth of artistic work emerged in reaction to an unraveled, uneven and contradictory global economic reality.
This dissertation charts how a transnational body of art grappled with this larger crisis of economic globalization over the ensuing decade. It begins with a critical and historical consideration of the concept of crisis, discussing how dominant economic narratives and theories, and their underlying values and promises, have come into question and failed to articulate any convincing alternative. I argue that the absence of scholarly consensus, and the larger sense of disorientation the Global Financial Crisis instilled in experts and laypeople alike, reveals a fundamental epistemological crisis and highlights the need for theoretical renewal in examining critical economic phenomena.
I develop an interdisciplinary approach, departing from Cultural Political Economy to explore the relationship of the aesthetic-cultural production of German and English-language novels, transnational film, and video games to cultural, political, and economic processes of confronting the crisis. Centralizing in-depth analyses of cultural artifacts, I identify aesthetic-cultural production as a privileged site to study the epistemological dimension of the crisis. Accounting for the unique semantic properties of decisively fictional discourses, I define three functions of cultural production. The communicative function explores how cultural production, and its narratives and tropes, can become part of dominant discourses. The critical function examines how different artistic media and their unique formal strategies can develop ambitions to intervene in the process of working through a crisis. Finally, the utopian function investigates how cultural production can serve as a laboratory for a renewal of social imagination, a place to work past an untenable status quo.

The Co-construction of Knowledge in Foreign Language Teacher-student Classroom Interactions
Author: Digruber, Sandra
Publication info: Georgetown University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22622736.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Interactions between instructors and students in the foreign language (FL) classroom have been researched from various angles, among others, in the fields of discourse analysis and conversation analysis (Markee, 2015a). While research has shown that classroom interactions facilitate learning (Walsh, 2011), an in-depth semantic perspective is rarely adopted. This study investigates how instructors at a private university in the United States support the co-construction of both language and content knowledge through their oral interactions with learners in a German FL class while discussing a magazine article. A systemic functional linguistics (SFL) framework has been used for the qualitative analysis of discourse semantics and lexicogrammar in classroom discourse. SFL was chosen due to its functional view of linguistic resources. Specifically, the concepts of SPEECH FUNCTIONS, MOOD, CLAUSE COMPLEX, and TRANSITIVITY informed the analysis of transcribed observations of three content- and language-integrated FL classrooms. The analysis was triangulated with semi-structured interviews with the respective instructor.
The analysis of SPEECH FUNCTIONS reveals that the discourse semantic moves of registering, elaborating, and extending can be particularly effective in the elicitation of knowledge. Furthermore, clarifying and confronting rejoinder moves seem to play an important role for the co-construction of knowledge. As far as linguistic realizations are concerned, all three instructors use a type of mitigation strategy for giving commands. The MOOD analysis shows that questions are usually congruently realized as wh- and polar interrogatives. On the syntactic level, instructors use less projection in their CLAUSE COMPLEXES than their students, who seem to quote the text as support for their statements. Finally, the TRANSITIVITY analysis demonstrates the instructors’ individual differences and their flexibility in word choices, despite the overlap of instructional materials. This research suggests a stronger focus on the effect of different discourse semantic moves and their linguistic realizations in teacher training and pedagogical practices for fostering more productive classroom communications. For example, an increased use of rejoinder moves can encourage the co-construction of content and language knowledge.

From Aesthetic to Pathology: Reading Literary Case Studies of Melancholy, 1775-1830
Author: Rettig, Noelle B.
Publication info: Georgetown University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22622064.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation contributes to the ongoing discussion of the narrative representation of mental illness in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, at a time when the nascent discipline of psychology began to come into its own, and the discourses of mind and body were renegotiated under advances in the medical sciences; I attempt, in other words, to examine how mental illness was conceptualized long before diagnoses such as depression, bipolarity, or schizophrenia made their way into mainstream scientific discourse. Even though “melancholy” continued to function during this time period as a blanket term for any number of mental, physical, and spiritual illnesses, thereby connoting a pathological state, it also began to take on a specifically “poetic” meaning, involving the subjective and transitory mood of the modern individual. As a focal point for this inquiry, I have chosen four primary texts: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Die Leiden des jungen Werther (1774), Friedrich Schiller’s Die Räuber (1781), Karl Philipp Moritz’s Anton Reiser (1785-1790), and Georg Büchner’s Lenz (1836) – works which all represent melancholy at the interstices of science and subjectivity, reason and passion. My major arguments are as follows: 1) with the publication of Goethe’s Werther in 1774, there was a shift toward pathological representations of melancholy in literature; 2) there are distinct parallels between the Melancholie of the eighteenth century and psychiatric diagnoses of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; 3) the popularity of my primary sources helped to establish a language for mental anguish in the late eighteenth century, even as this discourse functions at times via inarticulability; 4) the move toward pathology occurs as the literary subject becomes more psychologically developed and treated as a form of case study. In its entirety, the study investigates how multivalent images of melancholy are deployed in order to individuate characters and their respective psychologies, emotions, and affects.

Meta-Epic: Generic Interplay in Goethe's <em>Faust</em> and its Significance for <em>Weltliteratur</em>
Author: Grek, Heidi Nada
Publication info: Washington University in St. Louis, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22617173.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation argues that Faust can be read as a modern epic and, further, that its epic qualities can be used to open up a new perspective on the work and its relation to Goethe’s conception of World Literature. Building on the work of Jane Brown, Franco Moretti, and others, I explore the epic potential of both parts of Goethe’s drama by reading Faust against Paradise Lost, The Divine Comedy, and Byron’s Don Juan, situating all of these works within the broader context of the European epic tradition. My first chapter interprets Faust’s final vision as a reconstruction of Milton’s “paradise within”—in which divine creation is relegated to literary representation—as a metaphor for the creation of the epic in a secular, modern world. In the second chapter, I look at various spectacles and demonstrate that they illuminate the “super” within the natural, enabling the natural world to take the place of the divine in Faust. In the third chapter, I consider Faust as a variant of the English romantic epic and juxtapose Byron’s performative rewriting of the epic with Goethe’s dramatic reworking of it. Together, these chapters illuminate not only Faust’s place in the tradition, but also how it modifies conventions and establishes the drama as the legitimate successor to the ancient epic. Finally, in the epilogue, I demonstrate that Faust’s intertextuality and generic hybridity resists the representation of a single world or nation, dismantling the (national) boundaries that the epic genre has traditionally been seen to demarcate. Ultimately, Faust reorients the epic from the prevailing model of “national literatures” in Europe and toward one that promotes an international literary exchange that serves as the foundation for Goethe’s ideas on World Literature.

The Blank Space: Implications of Semiotic Nothingness in the Postwar Swiss Avant-garde

Abstract: This dissertation is a contextual study of blankness and its implications in the poetry and literary objects of two notable Swiss Avant-Garde artists: Eugen Gomringer and Dieter Roth. This study presents context beyond technological innovations in print and media as essential to these close readings. Marshaling methodological contributions from aesthetic theorists, I argue for a historicized analysis of meaning-making in the context of postwar German-speaking Europe. Blankness offers a rich and perplexing semantic field, and as a visual articulation of silence, serves as a repository of historical, social, and political information. The conveyance of meaning is weighed alongside new readings in the aesthetics of postwar silence, contributing a richer appreciation for blankness as a site of contest and negotiation in the Swiss experience.
In Part I, blankness in the works of Eugen Gomringer is examined. I argue that Gomringer’s participation in the global concrete poetry movement, and in specific his concept of the ideogram as a purified and utilitarian instrument, saw readability of blank space as an antidote for the German-speaker’s experience of Stunde Null and the shocking and inescapable realities of the Holocaust. This new poetic form was to be liberatory, universally comprehensible—never in doubt by the reader or the artist. However, as witnessed by the life and work of Dieter Roth in Part II of my dissertation, not all were in agreement with Concretism’s fetishization of a positivistic world view. Roth found the program too strict and Gorminger’s telling of the history of concrete poetry dubious, believing it leaned too much in his own favor. Furthermore, experience of WWII and its effects on Switzerland divided these men in their relationship with silence. For Gomringer, divergent nationalistic discourse was something blankness was meant to relieve. But for Roth, his own speechlessness, caused in part by war-related trauma that kept him in conflict with himself and others, was treated and explored—employed as expressive introspection.

A God in the Mechanism: German Language Theater and the Atomic Bomb, 1945–65
Author: Lang, Patrick Stephenson
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13884211.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation compiles and analyzes postwar theatrical representations of the nuclear threat to show how German-language theater strove to establish an aesthetic and political program adequate to a post-fascist, Cold War age. Drawing on more than 25 atomic plays written between 1945 and 1965, the dissertation demonstrates that competing aesthetic paradigms—the aesthetically conservative director-dominated theater (Intendantentheater), burlesques and grotesques, socialist realism, and the documentary drama—incorporated the threat of technological destruction, manifested in the Cold War arms race, to articulate conflicting positions on the viability of a completely secular society. Skirting obvious geopolitical issues, the atomic plays treated the atomic bomb as the symbol of a new technological unfreedom in a society stripped of religious authority and comprised a discourse on the prospect of re-establishing human agency. The dissertation examines eight works in depth: Max Frisch’s Die Chinesische Mauer, Curt Langenbeck’s Der Phantast, Carl Zuckmayer’s Das kalte Licht, Alfred Gong’s Zetdam: Ein Satyr-Spiel, Friedrich Dürrenmatt’s Der Erfinder and Die Physiker, Rolf Schneider’s Prozess Richard Waverly and Heinar Kipphardt’s In der Sache J. Robert Oppenheimer. Analyzed across the 20 years of their relative prominence, the atomic plays evince a loose developmental trajectory. Experimental attempts to render the atomic bomb stageable in the 1940s gave way to a tendency toward classical dramatic principles in the 1950s via the inclusion of the physicist as a protagonist. At the end of the 1950s and into the 1960s, these so-called physicist dramas were in decline. Their dominant theme, a binary setting religion and agency against technology and determinism, were undermined in tragi-comic works. In the 1960s, the documentary drama reframed the question of agency and the atomic bomb as an institutional, rather than primarily moral issue. Viewed collectively, the atomic plays evince the evolving cultural and political expectations of the postwar and the unique formal problems the atomic bomb posed to the theater.

Redrawing Time: Temporality in German-Language Graphic Narratives
Author: Hambro, Matthew
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13886409.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation investigates the form of time in German-language graphic narratives, exploring the role of layout, text/image, and the body in creating temporality. It argues that, what makes temporality in graphic narratives most powerful is sometimes overlooked in the search for a historical, generic, or formal center that typifies the medium. Instead, Redrawing Time places value on flexibility, exploring how a variety of temporalities that exist outside of or are interspersed throughout a primary narrative, expand and augment the temporal range and expressiveness of comics works. It approaches this question with a focus on formal features of graphic narratives that are used to establish temporality, showing how in many cases, German graphic narratives use these features to suspend, oppose, or augment progressive depictions of time. The first feature discussed is the use of paneling, the rectangular frames that divide the page and mark the passage of time. The second is the text-image relationship of graphic narrative, which can indicate sequence and duration through the use of dialog and narration. The third is the body, which often suggests movement, anticipation, and change. Redrawing Time shows how in a variety of settings, German graphic narratives leverage these features to provide a model for temporal reframing, offering alternative ways of connecting an outlook on time with values, beliefs, and avenues for action.
In part, the dissertation addresses a critical neglect of German comics and graphic narratives rooted in canonical comics theory, which often focuses on strategies for developing clear, forward-moving narratives. Explanations of graphic narratives that are rooted in formal progression correspond to a historical account of the medium, which, analogous to film, is seen as a way of bringing movement to image that emerges in 19th and 20th centuries. In addition to expanding such formal and historical accounts to make space for a discussion of German works, Redrawing Time paves the way for a broader discussion of the resistance of graphic narratives to the cultures of teleological thinking and accelerated lifestyle from which they are often suggested to emerge. However, rather than tracing a reactive trend in German graphic narratives that attempts to reinstate earlier philosophical and academic expectations for visual art, Redrawing Time shows how German graphic narratives challenge temporal traditions, utilizing the mechanics of the medium produce new experiences of temporality that help readers expand the horizons of their aesthetic and political agency.

A New Grammar of Images: Werner Herzog and the Contemporary Philosophy of Cinema
Author: Lamme, David Michael
Publication info: University of California, Irvine, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22623334.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: In his central mission of working on “a new grammar of images,” the German film director Werner Herzog presents a challenge to the philosophy of cinema. Pairing Herzog’s work with Deleuzian film theory, I argue against the prevalent secondary literature that Herzog’s oeuvre engages with an anti-romantic and non-ironic material philosophy in order to provide ethical challenges to a contemporary, connected world. Specifically focusing on spatiotemporal formations derived from empirical science, I demonstrate that Herzog’s approach to cinema utilizes a four-tiered semiotic that is at its core not merely a film theory, but rather an entire material philosophy of nature with profound ethical and political implications.

Old Books, New Times: Medieval Manuscripts and German Literature around 1800
Author: Hunter-Parker, Hannah
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22621443.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Old Books, New Times: Medieval Manuscripts and German Literature around 1800, explains an improbable development in German literary history: the “rediscovery” of medieval literature by modern writers and intellectuals around 1800. Why did texts and traditions that had been neglected, lost, or forgotten for centuries suddenly resurface in the writings of different movements, institutions, and writers, from Gottsched and Bodmer, to Lessing, the Schlegel brothers and Tieck? Old Books, New Times reveals this improbable resurfacing as the effect of specific media practices, in which technically obsolete forms like the parchment codex or the monastic library collided with alternate conditions for the production, circulation, and storage of literature in the present. Negotiations between old and new media served as a crucial impetus for modern German writers, as well as for the study and reception of earlier traditions beginning at this time. Over three chapters, the dissertation traces such negotiations to pivotal moments both in the respective writers’ oeuvres and to the larger literary system. The writers considered are central to the history and study of German literature, in questions of edition, genre, canon, conservation, and education. However, the status of their medieval sources as manuscripts and other old media in an age of rising print has never been addressed. The first book-length study of the topic, the dissertation builds on close readings of canonical texts, archival research, and studies of individual manuscripts and their modern readers. What is at stake in Old Books, New Times is ultimately a question of attentions: how do certain media techniques and technologies create interest in literary texts? How do these work to create literature in the first place?

Phlogisticated Relations: Lichtenberg and Ritter's Readings of Chemistry
Author: Malagon, Carolina Isabel
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13884319.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation addresses the persistence of an approach to chemistry that can be traced through German literary texts in the aftermath of the chemical revolution. Over the course of the 1780s and 1790s, established procedures of knowledge production came under fire from proponents of a new chemical system of practice. The stakes of these debates were high, limited not just to chemis-try: an entire way of reading the relations between things was affected. By focusing on two propo-nents of this way of reading who nonetheless responded very differently to the debates, Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742-1799) and Johann Wilhelm Ritter (1776-1810), this dissertation con-tributes new materials to the history of the period, assesses the role of pedagogy in reproducing practices, and draws essential links between chemical and literary representations.
Chapter 1 reconstructs Lichtenberg's approaches through the frame of audience. Both pub-licist and professor of physics, Lichtenberg conceived of his various audiences as participants in the pedagogical process, deploying coherent strategies to guide and to recruit them. Following the chains of his associations from his private notebooks to his public lectures and essays, the chapter examines how linguistic decisions contributed to this process and to the establishment of his own authority. Chapter 2 addresses the material dimension of Lichtenberg's practices through his work with various kinds of air. By operationalizing readings of properties, Lichtenberg staged perfor-mances that situated the body in a relationship with active powers. One of the first German physi-cists to teach chemical topics, Lichtenberg's treatment of airs illuminates the moral, poetic, and ep-istemic heart to his program. Chapter 3 uses Lichtenberg's critiques of decisiveness to reexamine debates over the new chemistry. Exemplified in those debates, but by no means limited to them, decisive rhetoric presented a threat to knowledge production as Lichtenberg understood it on mul-tiple fronts. Chapter 4, focused on Ritter, examines the emergence of his own decisive approach against the background of his training as an apothecary and studies in Jena. Diverging on how to represent analogies and in their self-presentations as authors, Ritter and Lichtenberg together demonstrate the complex interrelationships between chemical and poetic practices.

And You Shall Tell Your Children: The Intersection of Memory, Identity, and Narrative in Contemporary German Jewish Autofiction
Author: Killian, Doria Beth
Publication info: Georgetown University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22622646.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation examines the autofictional works of three Jewish women writing in German, combining a close textual analysis with a narratological framework in order to understand how narrative, storytelling, and writing are used at both the diegetic and meta-levels to negotiate familial and cultural memory and to construct a contemporary German Jewish identity. The works analyzed herein—Barbara Honigmann’s Roman von einem Kinde (1986), Damals, dann und danach (1999), and Ein Kapitel aus meinem Lebens (2004); Gila Lustiger’s So sind wir (2005); and Katja Petrowskaja’s Vielleicht Esther (2015)—are all written by second- or third-generation post-Holocaust Jews whose familial pasts include stories of exile, deportation, and internment, and whose individual presents are marked by trauma, intergenerational silence, and multiplex identities. As they navigate these heavy subjects, interweaving stories of their parents’ and grandparents’ lives alongside tales from their own childhoods and contemporary lives, each of these authors also thematizes narrative itself, rendering storytelling, writing, and literature as significant to these works as the stories and anecdotes contained within them. Using memory theory from a variety of scholars to examine this thematization of narrative and its connection to memory, identity, and family dynamics, I argue that, rather than being used to merely recount the past, narrative in these works becomes the very site in which familial and individual identity is constructed and construed. In addition, each chapter also centers on a narratological element that is particularly salient in each of the three authors’ work, specifically: plot/narrativity, metanarration, and intertextuality. I then relate the thematization of narrative at the diegetic level to the author’s own construction of narrative at the meta-level, using feminist narratological scholarship to explore the interrelation of content and form. This dissertation serves to further the ongoing scholarly conversation on memory, identity, and belonging in relation to contemporary German Jewish life and, in its conception of narrative as contingent on cultural context rather than as proceeding from universal norms, also contributes to postclassical feminist narratology and works to broaden our understanding of the role of narrative in human life.

The Gentle Subversion of the Essay and the Essay Film
Author: Karkare, Sayalee
Publication info: University of Colorado at Boulder, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22615053.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: In my dissertation I argue that the essay form, specifically the subjective first-person essay, has the potential to be an effective medium of expression for marginalized and dissenting voices in society. I draw on a long tradition of the essayistic to present my perspective that the essay’s reliance on subjectivity and reflexivity, its dialogic nature, and its freedom from form, make it particularly well-suited for making subversive observations in a non-polemical, unobtrusive manner. Using the examples of essay films made by Helke Sander and Agnès Varda that focus on the female experience, specifically their depiction of the comportment of the female body in public, I argue the essay form allows them to bring private experiences into the public sphere. By way of first person narration, their protagonists are able to provide a unique insight into their situations; the use of direct address rouses the spectator from passivity and the open-endedness of the form encourages critical reflection on the subject at hand. My dissertation is supplemented by an essay film of my own on the relationship between language and writing, accompanied by an artist’s statement in which I expand on my own filmmaking practises.

Identity and Capital During Telecollaboration in the German Language Classroom
Author: Lesoski, Carly M.
Publication info: Michigan State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 22617798.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation presents findings from a research project on a 7-week-long telecollaboration project between students at a US-American university and students at a Southern German university. This dissertation utilizes theories of identity and capital to analyze the experiences of two heritage language learners (HLLs) during telecollaborative exchanges, as well as in classroom discussion forum posts and in a follow-up interview. Identity refers to a person’s understanding of their place in a given context, as well as their understanding of their possibilities for the future (Darvin & Norton, 2015; Norton, 2013). Capital refers to the social goods one possesses, such as wealth, knowledge, networks, and language abilities (Darvin & Norton, 2015). While each of the two subjects came from different backgrounds and had different relationships to their German heritages, both negotiated their identities and their relationships to their capital during the telecollaboration. The results of this study support previous findings which suggest that telecollaboration can offer HLLs a place to negotiate their identities as members of target language-speaking communities (see Telles, 2015). While Kathy was able to negotiate a more stable identity and sharpen her focus on her imagined futures, Lilly’s experience was marked by a greater deal of ambiguity toward both her identities and her capital. This dissertation offers pedagogical, theoretical, and methodological implications, as well as directions for future research on HLLs’ identities and capital during telecollaboration.

Optimality Theory and the Semiotic Triad: A New Approach for Songwriting, Sound Recording, and Artistic Analysis
Author: Fragomeni, Michael
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13864902.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Songwriters have always taken full advantage of the ‘artistic license’ offered them by their listeners. This dissertation investigates the freedoms and limitations of artistic license by examining language in the musical environment. This dissertation uses Optimality Theory as its method of analysis together with Peircean Semiotics. The OT analysis includes examples from both English and German and investigates the musical environment on syntactic, morphological, and phonological levels. The dissertation also explores the potential impact that songs can have on spoken language by considering the differences between modifications and innovations in songwriting. Additionally, I examine the roles iconicity and arbitrariness play in art and pop culture. As evolving principles of the Sign, iconicity and arbitrariness interact with one another in an overlapping manner, thus producing new innovations in art and language. These new innovations are then conventionalized, creating a new layer upon which more innovations take place. The fractal nature of this process adds credence to the reproductive nature of Peirce’s Triad. Lastly, this dissertation applies Peirce’s Triad to the art form of sound recording to shed light on that creative process and is then applied for an analysis of dissimilar musical genres to add further explication on the differing expectations of those musical genes.

Nietzsche, Luther, and <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>
Author: Noah, Temitope Abisoye
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13811743.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation reads Friedrich Nietzsche’s Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-1885) under the supposition that Martin Luther was a major concern for Nietzsche when he wrote the epic. Up to date, no major text on Zarathustra has taken Nietzsche’s view of Luther seriously. In placing Nietzsche’s view of Luther at the center of my investigation, my research bridges this gap in scholarly literature and opens possibilities for new interpretations of the epic. I demonstrate that much of the subtext of Zarathustra responds to Luther’s legacy and soteriology, and that this centrality of Luther in Zarathustra not only restructures our understanding of the epic, but also provides significant insight into Nietzsche’s perception of Luther.

The Survival of Literature: Kafka and the Problem of Finitude
Author: Zechner, Dominik
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13811334.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation revolves around representations and suspensions of finitude in the work of modernist German-speaking writer Franz Kafka, attempting both to offer a new take on Kafka’s much-discussed oeuvre as well as to make larger claims about the nature of literary modernity and the ontology of literature. The Survival of Literature investigates the modes in which finitude is poeticized, thematized, and realized in Kafka’s narratives—both explicitly and implicitly. From the ways in which Kafka achieves (or fails to achieve) textual closure; via the problematic depiction of scenes of mortality and death in his writings; through his own theo-philosophical reflections on dying and pain—I develop what I call Kafka’s “thanato-philology:” a literary program that revolves around the irrepresentability, if not the sheer impossibility of death, putting in place a non-representational model of language in which death does not simply mark the threshold of sheer absence—but is exposed as the opening toward a movement of liminal survival, which not only describes a mode of existence or living-on but becomes legible also as poetic strategy and philological structure.
My reflections start from the observation that death scenes in Kafka are often contaminated by an element of survival that interferes with the proposed termination, putting the promise of closure on hold. The most prominent example for this strange ambivalence when it comes to writing death is perhaps the very last scene of Kafka’s second novel, Der Proceß, where Josef K., the protagonist, is executed—yet in its ultimate gesture the novel introduces the potential of survival: “Wie ein Hund!” sagte er, es war, als sollte die Scham ihn überleben (“‘Like a dog!’ he said; it was as though the shame should survive him”). The last word of the novel, in the German original, reads: survive (“überleben”). I argue that the emphasis on survival points to a key dimension in Kafka’s understanding of finitude: the boundary of death, as it were, must be transgressed by a certain (linguistic) excess—a surplus irreducible to the narrated manifestation of death but which itself remains void of representation.
Critically developing this notion of finitude is pivotal for it shows Kafka going against the grain of an entire century obsessed with finality and death: on the theoretical front, from Walter Benjamin’s dictum on the “authority of death” as motivating all story-telling, via Martin Heidegger’s definition of existence as being-toward-death, to French existentialism. And on the political front, as expressed by an enthusiasm for destruction that not only wrought two World Wars but also led to the genocidal disasters marking the histories of Germany and the Soviet Union. Kafka stands at odds with the death cults of his time, radically problematizing the relation between death, closure, and finitude in his writings.

Irony and “Unpolitics” in Wartime: An Overdue Critical Analysis of Thomas Mann’s <em>Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen</em> and Its Place in the Critical Theory Tradition
Author: Wagner, James C.
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13811693.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation offers a thorough, much-needed critical analysis of the German novelist Thomas Mann’s monumental 918 essay Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen (Reflections of a Non-Political Man), in which Mann delivers an often embarrassingly naïve defense of the imperial German government’s aims in the First World War and which thus has alternately been maligned or ignored by most scholars of the author’s literary work. However, the essay also represents a thorough self-audit of the problematic aesthetic foundations of Mann’s literary artistry. As such, it is a key text for understanding the themes, techniques, and aesthetic principles that characterize the whole of his literary output both before and in the wake of the so-called Great War. My dissertation places Mann’s condemnable defense of Germany’s war effort in the context of the aesthetic crisis in which he simultaneously found himself, in order to uncover the intellectual and cultural roots of his lifelong literary philosophy. I also argue for reading the Betrachtungen not just as a sincere essay or polemic, but as a kind of poetic text that operates in ways similar to his fictional work.
The first chapter studies Mann’s peculiarly German distinction between a specifically Western European concept of “civilization” – as an abstract universalist principle committed to radical political action under the banner of a totalizing rational intellect – and a uniquely German notion of “culture” as a pluralistic moral force that preserves the particularity of the elements it binds together in the name of all-encompassing, unrationalizable “life.”
My second chapter analyzes Thomas Mann’s feud with his democratically-minded brother Heinrich as a way of approaching the former’s rejection of “politics,” construed as the “one-sided,” absolutist doctrine through which civilization expresses and enacts its ideological program both in the social sphere and in the realm of literature. Against politics, Mann proposes a program of “all-sided” “aestheticism” aimed at questioning and relativizing any and all truth claims.
The subject of the third and final chapter is “erotic irony,” the means by which aestheticism is expressed and, for Mann, not just a literary technique essential to the genre of the novel, but also an ethical and intellectual attitude. Mannian irony, I argue, represents a radical critique of the dialectic of Western enlightenment, and Mann’s definition and defense of this concept in the Betrachtungen eines Unpolitischen place his problematic essay squarely within the German tradition of Critical Theory represented by philosophers such as Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno.

Die Möglichkeiten der Sinne: Wahrnehmungsmodelle und Wirklichkeitsinszenierungen bei Robert Musil und Rainer Maria Rilke
Author: Bubacz, Ferdinand

ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation Die Möglichkeiten der Sinne. Wahrnehmungsmodelle und Wirklichkeitsinszenierungen bei Robert Musil und Rainer Maria Rilke examines the historical correlation between literary modernism and the scientific production and transformation of knowledge in Germany and Austria around 1900 through analysis of the literary construction of reality in Musil’s and Rilke’s prose and reconstruction of their models of perception in their theoretical writings. In contrast to the quantitative methods of scientific materialism that posit a world without qualities, these two modernist authors engage theoretically with innate capacities of perception, while drawing on the empirical investigation of the senses: both authors devise poetic models of perception that are informed by the psychological and biological knowledge of their time but focus less on the process of cognition and more on the subjective experience of the qualities of perception.
The first part of the dissertation focuses on the marginal writings of Robert Musil by analyzing the narrative experiments and scientific notes of his early diaries, arguing that the concept of a ‘sense of possibility’ is also rooted in his study of perceptual psychology. Drawing on the psychopathological study of T. K. Oesterreich, Musil formulates an equilibrium-model of perception that accentuates the formative emotional dimension of perceived reality. A close reading of Musil’s Die Vollendung der Liebe demonstrates the correspondences to Musil’s model and analyzes the poetics of balance in his novella. In the second part, I reconstruct Rainer Marie Rilke’s model of perception, informed by the subjective biology of Jakob von Uexküll and his notion of ‘Umwelt’, through analysis of his concept of ‘schauen’ in his letters on the Florentine Renaissance, Auguste Rodin and Paul Cézanne. A reading of Rilke’s short prose texts Erlebnis, Puppen and Ur-Geräusch concludes the study and reveals the relation of these texts to Adolf Koelsch’s biological concept of ‘Erlebnis’, claiming that this biological notion of subjective experience informs the representation of perception in Rilke’s late prose miniatures.
The dissertation ultimately argues that Musil and Rilke conceive of literature as a medium that can both adopt and question scientific methods of inquiry and contribute to the historical knowledge of the senses; due to a broader perspective that is not bound to a scientific research area, literature can poetically explore those aspects of human perception that evade materialist explanations. The analysis of Musil’s and Rilke’s ‘anthropoetics’ of the senses thus also explores how the formation of knowledge at the beginning of the 20th century reflects the paradigmatic relation between arts and science in Modernity.

Built on Sand: Weimar Republic Representation and the November Revolution
Author: Larson, Sean
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13811717.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation provides a social materialist interpretation of Weimar era aesthetic innovation. While socially-rooted criticism of Weimar art and literature abound in German Studies, the defining feature of the Weimar Republic social reality is usually assumed to be the foundational Great War. This dissertation re-reads the pioneering aesthetic work of the period through the lens of the Republic’s founding revolution.
The central category linking the political, social, and economic features of the revolutionary years with the aesthetic theories of the Republic’s foremost thinkers is the category of representation. The possibility for both political and aesthetic representation rests upon the separation of subject and object, which has provided a productive dilemma for aesthetic theory. The German revolution (1918–1923), through its mass socio-political participation and impact on the market mechanisms structuring German economic life, shattered this foundational dualism. In doing so, the revolution inaugurated a social reality in which new forms of representational experimentation would flourish—what has been called high modernism. The revolution, however, like the republic and the modernist representational approaches themselves, would ultimately not live up to its promise, only leaving remnants of its explosive representational caesura in its artifacts and in one particular practice developed over the course of its early years, political education.
The first two chapters of the dissertation reconstruct the events of the German revolution and their tremendous social impact upon Weimar society. Up to its culmination in 1923, the revolutionary movement increasingly became identified with the thriving and chaotic communist party of Germany (KPD), the activities of which are the subject of much of these chapters. The following two chapters re-interpret two pillars of Weimar Republic aesthetic innovation through the lens of the revolution: the Neue Sachlichkeit literary movement, exemplified by the writings of Erik Reger, and the innovative political theater developed through Bertolt Brecht’s learning plays. The final chapter traces the development of political education in the German workers’ movement before and during the revolution until its culmination and fusion with the general practice of the revolutionary movement, and presents this new style of political education as one-time the answer to the representational dilemma so often confronted on the aesthetic plane.

Rehearsal for the Eschaton
Author: Cho, Hyowon
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13810809.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation addresses the question of how deep the Western world has been, and still is, engulfed in the flame called “the political-theological.” While exploring the ruins of the Weimar Republic, it draws together four intellectuals: the philosopher Walter Benjamin, the theologian Erik Peterson (1890–1960), the jurist Carl Schmitt (1888–1985) and, lastly, the historian of Jewish mysticism Gershom Scholem (1897–1982). I argue that the actual and virtual confrontations between them merit a close examination because behind them lie burning and cardinal issues such as the questions of Jewish Christianity, the crisis of political and spiritual authority, and, last but not least, German and Christian anti-Semitism. I have chosen the title Rehearsal for the Eschaton for two reasons. First, it is in the intense presentiment of looming catastrophe—the end of the world—that the four intellectuals struggled to interpret and/or change the world in which they lived. Second, they were all engrossed in thinking theatrically. In doing so, they each endeavored to exhaust, accelerate, delay, and bypass the end of the world. In other words, they all rehearsed for the eschaton, a figure that is able to unite Jesus Christ and the Jewish Messiah. With the exception of the theologian, all the protagonists of Rehearsal have long since established themselves as inexhaustible objects of research in the field of humanities as well as in the political and social sciences. I conclude that Benjamin, Peterson, Schmitt, and Scholem constitute a community of affinity.

Phonological and Morphological Patterns in Old High German Umlaut
Author: Boutilier, Matthew
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13900065.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Scholarly treatments of umlaut (i-mutation) in Old High German observe, as far back as the earliest handbooks (e.g., Braune 1886), that *hC clusters tend to block umlaut of short *a to e, but stop short of regarding the fronting and raising of short a → e before *i(ː) or *j ("primary umlaut") as a diachronically intermediate step between Germanic raising of e before i (e.g., pre-Gmc *nemizi → PGmc *nimizi 'du nimmst') and the more comprehensive fronting of long *ā and back vowels before *i ("secondary umlaut"). By obtaining and analyzing data on the success rate of orthographic umlaut with respect to various phonological and morphological environments, this dissertation lays the groundwork for painting a more nuanced picture of the evolution of German umlaut in accordance with the "Wisconsin School" view (Buccini 1992, Iverson & Salmons 1996, Howell & Salmons 1997) that primary umlaut is to be regarded not as a monolithic sound change but as gradual process that began in certain environments and later spread to others.
I examine tokens from two major OHG texts (Otfrid's Evangelienbuch and two different MSs of the German-Latin glossary Abrogans) as well as three shorter texts with diverse chronological and geographical origins (the OHG Isidor, the Murbacher Hymnen, and the poetic fragment Muspilli). Besides marking for the obvious features (umlauted vowel written as , trigger as , and intervening consonants), I also assign the morphological relationship between trigger and umlautable vowel to one of four categories that represent diminishing presence of an umlaut trigger in the paradigm: Root trigger: megin 'strength' ← *magin-a- Stem trigger: steti 'place (DAT)’ ← *stad-i- Inflectional trigger: ferit 'goes' ← *far-i-d Derivational trigger: kihenkitha 'agreement' ← *ga-hang-iþō-
The resulting data attest different manifestations of primary umlaut between the source texts but parallel overall patterns in the phonological and morphological spread of umlaut of short *a in Old High German, which can shed critical light on how the process of primary umlaut originated.

The Thirty Years' War as Unifying Heritage: Historical Fiction, Ecumenism, and German Nation-Building (1871-1920)
Author: Barthold, Emily Elizabeth Sieg
Publication info: Georgetown University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13863063.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: To investigate how literary narratives of the Thirty Years' War could reinterpret this conflict as unifying heritage for Protestants and Catholics in the Imperial German nation-state, this study presents the results of a survey of thirty-four German-language historical novels published between 1871 and 1920 that seek to narrate a national history of the Thirty Years' War. This war, which took place roughly between 1618 and 1648, has generally been termed a religious war, and when Imperial German novelists wrote historical fictions about the war, they wrote under the assumption that their readership basically understood the Thirty Years' War as a conflict fought between the Imperial Catholic forces of the Holy Roman Empire and the motley Protestant factions who resisted. Given the salience of confession in the popular imagination of the Thirty Years' War, this study explores how literary portrayals of this conflict reflect Imperial German understandings of what it meant to be German and whether this "Germanness" was contingent upon confession. To address this guiding question, the study is divided into four chapters which consider confessional identities under the lens of gender, region, language, and modernity, respectively. In spite of the diversity of modes of historical scholarship and political thought from 1871 to 1920, this study argues that literary treatments of the Thirty Years' War from this period: (1) mask contemporary concerns in historical imaginings in order to comment on topics such as national unity, ecumenical reconciliation, Macht- and Moralpolitik, women's and Jewish (anti-)emancipation, and/or the legitimacy of violence; (2) consistently recast power politics and greed, as opposed to religion, as the driving force behind this catastrophic war in order to present the collective trauma of the Thirty Years' War as both the crucible of an overarching German national identity and a warning against the peril of internal German division; and (3) in a vast majority of cases portray German national identity as compatible with the Protestant as well as Catholic confessions, and in a minority of cases with Jewish and other religious identities.

Literarische Identätskonstruktionen und das Verhältnis zu Deutschland in ausgesuchten Werken zeitgenössischer jüdischer Schriftstellerinnen Deutscher Sprache

Abstract: A declaration of her love for Germany by the Jewish author Lena Gorelik in her semi-autobiographical text Lieber Mischa ( Dear Mischa 2011) has led me to ask whether the Holocaust is still the point of reference and central characteristic of the self-conception of the contemporary or third generation of Jewish writers in Germany after 1945. In addition to Gorelik's text, this study analyzes Katja Petrowskaja's Maybe Esther (2014) and Olga Grjasnowa's All Russians Love Birch Trees (2012). The three Jewish women writers immigrated from Eastern Europe, live in Germany, and write in German. I show that their texts belong to the genre of autofiction. The third generation of authors, publishing after 2010, is part of the ‘new’ German Jewry, which is composed mainly of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their children—a fact that significantly influences contemporary Jewish identity in Germany.
I argue that the authors voice their desire for ‘normalization’ in the German-Jewish relationship in these autofictional books: The texts show that, generally speaking, the Holocaust is no longer the central characteristic of Jewish identity in Germany, but rather a request for a peaceful, undisturbed, ‘normal’ life in Germany. My analysis of the literary identities the authors constructed for their protagonists sheds light on current trends in contemporary Jewish life in Germany and demonstrates that they reject the special status assigned to them as ‘victims of the Holocaust’ or as ‘exotic,’ both in the sense that they are seen as representatives of the Jewish minority and as ‘immigrants’ from the former USSR. This ascription of ‘otherness’ nourishes both philo- and anti-Semitic discrimination. Although the novels mark the Holocaust as an event that should never be forgotten, it is not history but rather the experience of ‘otherness’ that keeps Jewish life in Germany from being ‘normal.’ Only if German society viewed Jews living in Germany as unspectacular, i.e. ‘normal,’ would a state of ‘normalcy’ be achieved, which in itself would be a “triumph,” as Gorelik's protagonist puts it, over the attempted extermination of Jews during National Socialism.

Impossible Communities in Prague's German Gothic: Nationalism, Degeneration, and the Monstrous Feminine in Gustav Meyrink's <i>Der Golem </i> (1915)
Author: Braun, Amy M.

Abstract: My dissertation investigates the contribution of Gustav Meyrink’s best-selling novel The Golem/Der Golem (1915) to the second revival of the international Gothic. While previous scholarship suggests that this genre disappeared from the German literary landscape in the 1830s, I interpret The Golem as a Gothic contribution to the “Prague Novel,” a trend in Prague-based, turn-of-the-twentieth-century German-language literature that found inspiration in the heated sociocultural and political tensions that characterized the milieu.
Structured around the demolition of Prague’s former Jewish ghetto under the auspices of the Finis Ghetto plan, a historic Czech-led urban renewal project that leveled the district of Josefov/Josephstadt between 1895 and 1917, The Golem portrays a German-speaker’s perspective on ghetto clearance and its impact on the city’s ethnic minority groups. Not only does Meyrink’s novel aestheticize the pessimism felt by many of Prague’s middle class and aristocratic German speakers living in a city governed by Czech nationalists; it also exemplifies a trend in Prague-based German-language literature to use the Gothic mode to translate experiences of ethnic marginalization, the rise of nationalism, and fears of social degeneracy. Like Max Brod’s A Czech Servant Girl/Ein tschechisches Dienstmädchen (1909) and Paul Leppin’s “The Ghost of the Jewish Town”/“Das Gespenst der Judenstadt” (1914), The Golem opens a window onto the cultural controversies and debates at the Jahrhundertwende that coalesced in radical municipal action targeting Prague’s German-speaking Christian and Jewish communities.
Drawing upon theories of the Gothic highlighting cultural despondency, trauma, and human monstrosity, this dissertation argues that The Golem recreated the Finis Ghetto as an analog to the homogenization and expulsion of Prague’s all of German-speaking communities under Czech political leadership. The Golem addresses the radical social, linguistic, and economic reform enacted by Czech nationalist movements in three ways: 1) by portraying the “German experience” in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Prague after the entanglements of cultural privilege have dissipated; 2) by providing a representation of the social depravities in the ghetto that Czech nationalists cited as reasons to demolish Josefov/Josephstadt and disperse the city’s German-speaking non-Jewish and Jewish communities; and 3) by challenging the effectiveness of the Finis Ghetto in purging the city of its “monsters”—particularly its degenerate, promiscuous women. The Golem ultimately suggests, as I outline, that without social reform to accompany physical renovation of the city, these “monsters” will continue to plague Prague society.

<i>Im Gefilz von Kräften</i>: The Language of Force in Robert Musil's <i>Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften</i>
Author: Agins, Jonathan

ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation examines the language of force in Robert Musil’s Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (MoE) as a site of literary self-reflection. It investigates how the text employs a constellation of “force” terms—including not only the words Kraft, Energie, and Leistung, but also images of physical and chemical forces such as heat, and electromagnetic force fields—to construct images of its own procedures and effects. The dissertation’s point of departure is the suggestive image of “likeness-force” (Gleichniskraft ) in chapter 116 of MoE that compares the interpretive process of reducing a likeness (Gleichnis) to a univocal concept to the physical process of boiling down (auskochen) a foaming solution in order to stabilize it—losing the forces of its most volatile elements in the process. Interpreting the novel from the perspective of the image of likeness-force, this dissertation addresses problems that arise from it: what is this force? What are its effects? How does it distinguish the “figurative” language of Gleichnisse from the “discursive” language of concepts? How is it “like” and “unlike” the physical force that it is compared to? These questions have important implications for interpreting the novel’s ethical and political engagement—a problem that has polarized MoE scholarship during the past several decades and that touches upon broader questions concerning the effects of literary language. Does “likeness-force” include the capacity to transform the reader’s ethical and political ideas? Or does such an “applied” reading constitute a “boiling down” of literary language that reduces “likeness-force?” I will argue that likeness-force lies primarily in the text’s capacity to generate a multiplicity of possible interpretations that attract and resist the reader’s desire for univocal significance. Subsequently, the text constitutes a Gefilz von Kräften: a tangle of forces that precludes the certainty of linear order but also constitutes its own unity—just as the etymologically linked image of “felt” is an aggregate of matted fibers that also constitutes a smooth surface.

Touching Temperature: Questions of Measurement and Feeling, 1870-1930
Author: Christensen, Alice R.
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 13423358.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The dissertation uncovers a set of questions about temperature, as quality and quantity, as feeling and measurement, in German thought between 1870 and 1930. The history of this idea includes debates central to academic philosophy in the latter half of the nineteenth century, but belongs not only narrowly to philosophy or to physical theory. Instead, the dissertation shows the interconnection of concerns both scholarly and worldly, as these emerged from a diverse network of media, techniques, instruments, and bodies. The texts that intervened in the question of temperature—scientific reports, philosophical treatises and debates, literary works, and popular ephemera—expose a set of questions concerning the distinction between quantity and quality, the relationship between Erkenntnis and experience, and what it meant to dwell in a world of carefully regulated temperature. In the years around 1900, temperature traversed a vast cultural field, acting as both Zusammenhang and point of contention. Chapter One of this dissertation examines the texts and other documents of an obsession with temperature in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In Chapter Two, I take seriously a claim by the philosopher Hermann Cohen, that the concept of degree—a particularly important concept for him—originated with our sensory apprehension of temperature. In that long history, a continual entwinement of quality and what we now call temperature is found; these two strands met explicitly in the thought of the eighteenth century philosopher Christian Wolff. The conclusions that Wolff reached, with both Scholastic philosophy and Fahrenheit’s thermometers at hand, were felt in the late nineteenth century, in the debate over the measurability of sensation—which was, in many ways, an argument about the meaning of the term quality. This is the subject of Chapter Three, in which we examine nineteenth-century research into the temperature sense and the philosophical debate in which this research came to play a leading role. The terrain of the term quality had changed quite a bit since Wolff’s pronouncement that “gradus sunt quantitates qualitatum.” While philosophers and psychologists continued to invoke various definitions of the term, quality no longer appeared to be a useful category in the study of the physical world. Temperature, with its long association with quality, and the vexed and ambiguous assocation of both with the senses, became a site of productive tension. In Chapter Four, texts by Robert Musil, Robert Walser, and Franz Kafka are shown to address the situation of dwelling in modernity; in literary experiments, the relationship between writing and the structures of experience is explored using concepts and figures of indoor heating. The dissertation closes with a brief afterword on the notion of temperature as medium, milieu, Zusammenhang.

The Science of Expression: <i>Ausdruckskunde</i> and Bodily Knowledge in German Modernist Culture
Author: Vollgraff, Matthew H.
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2019. 10982434.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: From the late 1870s to the early 1930s, an interdisciplinary field named Ausdruckskunde flourished throughout German-speaking Europe. Its proponents analyzed the expressive movements of both human and nonhuman bodies as a medium of nondiscursive knowledge—whether psychological, aesthetic, historical, or all at once. Until now the full interdisciplinary scope of this “science of expression” has largely escaped scholarly notice; yet as this dissertation argues, the long-neglected history of Ausdruckskunde has profound implications for the way we understand the interrelations of art and science in German modernity. The spread of evolutionary anthropology, physiological aesthetics and new media technologies during this turbulent period exacerbated the problematic status of somatic expression, a phenomenon which then as now directly challenges oppositions between inner and outer, mind and matter, individual and social, and natural and artificial. Ausdruckskunde arose in response to these virulent uncertainties, proposing a heterogenous epistemology of bodily gesture that unsettled more established ways of knowing in both the natural and the human sciences.
Over eight chapters examining the work of figures like Charles Darwin, Wilhelm Wundt, August Schmarsow, Aby Warburg, Ludwig Klages, Sergei Eisenstein, Max Scheler and Helmuth Plessner, I demonstrate how the “terra incognita” of expressive movement provoked a number of unprecedented close encounters and collaborations between far-flung methods and practices. The more they tried to resolve the problem of expression, I argue, the more these artists, scientists and scholars were compelled to displace the logic of individual sciences and produce new connections between them. Transgressing disciplinary boundaries in the pursuit of a more labile bodily knowledge, the itinerant science of expression remapped the relationships between nature and culture, art and language, memory and history, and human and nonhuman life in ways that have become more pertinent today than ever before.

Hellbound in El Salvador: Heavy Metal as a Philosophy of Life in Central America
Author: Pack, Christian
Publication info: The Johns Hopkins University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 13890057.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Heavy Metal in El Salvador has been a driving force of the underground culture since the Civil War in the 1980s. Over time, it has grown into a large movement that encompasses musicians, producers, promoters, media outlets and the international exchange of music, ideas and live shows. As a music based around discontent with society at large, Heavy Metal attempts to question the status quo through an intellectual exploration of taboo subjects and the presentation of controversial live shows. As an international discourse, Heavy Metal speaks to ideas of both socio-political and individual power based around a Philosophy of Life that exalts personal freedoms and personal responsibility to oneself and their society. As a community, it represents a ‘rage’ group, as defined by Peter Sloterdijk, that questions Western epistemologies and the doctrines of Christian Philosophy. This is done in different ways, by different genres, but at the heart is the changing of macro- (international) discourses into micro- (local) discourses that focus on those issues important to the geographic specificity of the region. In the case of Black Metal, born in Norway, it is interpreted in El Salvador through the similarities between the doctrines of Hitler and those of the most famous dictator in the country’s history – General Maximiliano Hernandez – and then applied, ironically, to the local phenomena of the Salvadoran Street Gangs (MS-13 and 18s) and their desired extermination. It is also done through the re-interpreting of folk metal in the local phenomenon of tribal metal that reinterprets the indigenous through the lens of modern society and heavy metal’s ideas of power. Finally, the Salvadoran metalhead adapts the genre’s vulgarity and dark humor to fuel their own systems of dealing with harsh repression and existing within a society that seems to have no place for them. At the bottom though, much more than a community, Heavy Metal in El Salvador is a source of fraternalismo that utilizes the Philosophy of Life to bind its members together and to provide them a means by which to express their personal freedoms within a society that would happily see them limited.

Poet-translators in Nineteenth Century French Literature: Nerval, Baudelaire, Mallarmé
Author: Whitaker, Jena
Publication info: The Johns Hopkins University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 13890044.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The ‘poet-translator is a listener whose ears are transformed through translation. The ear not only relates to the sensorial, but also to the cultural and historical. This dissertation argues that the ‘poet-translator,’ whose ears encounter a foreign tongue discovers three new rhythms: a new linguistic rhythm, a new cultural rhythm, and a new experiential rhythm. The discovery of these different rhythms has a pronounced impact on the poet-translator’s poetics. In this case, poetics does not refer to the work of art, but instead to an activity. It therefore concerns the reader’s will to listen to what a text does and to understand how it works.
Although the notion of the ‘poet-translator’ pertains to a wide number of writers, time periods, and fields of study, this dissertation focuses on three nineteenth-century ‘poet-translators’ who each partly as a result of their contact with German romanticism formed an innovative and fresh account of linguistic, cultural, and poetic rhythm: Gérard de Nerval (1808-1855), Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867), and Stéphane Mallarmé (1842-1898). Each of these ‘poet-translators acted as cultural mediators, contributing to the development of new literary genres and new forms of critique that came to have significant effects on Western Literature.
A study of Nerval, Baudelaire and Mallarmé as ‘poet-translators’ is historically pertinent for at least four reasons. First, how did these writers react to the emergence of comparative linguistics within the nineteenth-century? Second, what were the effects and outcomes of key technological advances, for example in the domain of the printing industry and in transportation? Third, what was the new geography of cultures and conception of nation that developed during 1815-1914? Fourth, how did the methods of translation change in nineteenth-century France? These four questions relate to cultural shifts that would have wide ranging consequences on the theorization of poetry and its translation that developed during the twentieth and twenty-first century by poet-translator-critics such as Walter Benjamin, Henri Meschonnic, Michel Deguy, and Yves Bonnefoy.

Recalling the Word: the Germanic Beguine "Sisters", Memory, and the Question of Genre
Author: Damiani, Adrienne Noelle
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 13420731.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Despite the renaissance of interest in medieval mystical texts over the past three decades, an investigation of literary form and genre classifications has not yet occurred at great length. Shorter articles concerning genre and gender (e.g. Veerle Fraeter's many articles on the subject come to mind) have often taken a contrary approach to Derrida's lecture "The Law of Genre", seeking to establish female-authored literature as comparable to that of men, and arguing for an even-handed application of theoretical analysis and treatment of women's literature. Although beguine literature and other writings by women have often been classified by adjectives such as "emotional", or in different terms than more scholastic writings, I argue that beguine mystical works be approached on par with that of other contemporaneous mystical writers (e.g. Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, and a corpus of texts going back to St. Bernard of Clairvaux). Highlighting the works of three key beguine mystics—Hadewijch of Brabant, Mechthild of Magdeburg, and Agnes Blannbekin—my focus is that of (1) form and (2) the intrinsic relationship between form and content in order to depict the highly "individualistic" nature of each text, as well as the strong didactic reasoning at the heart of literary form selection and creation.
Each main chapter of my dissertation focuses on a different mystic, ordered chronologically, to provide the space to discuss the construction and organization of the texts written by Hadewijch, Mechthild and Agnes individually. Although textual form is the primary object of investigation, the body chapters also highlight the main themes within their writings, provide close readings of significant or exemplary chapters, and demonstrate the ways in which these themes and excerpts intersect. The underlying aspect behind the investigation of form and content outlined above is the interest in the connection between method and meaning, text creation and readership.
Although the discussion of each mystic's work is outlined in Chapters Three through Five, Chapter One and Two provide a theoretical and historical background to the discussion of the beguine mystical texts. The initial discussion focuses on Derrida, gender and genre, and the counterarguments posited by feminist and gender scholars of the beguines. My aim is to explicate how a focus on genre and gender has shifted from the textual evidence and led scholars away from a philological-oriented close readings, which would connect form, structure and content. The second line of inquiry in the first chapter is the question of text classification and the rediscovery of the medieval mystical texts. The nineteenth-century focus on taxonomical categorization altered the ways in which these texts have been considered, analyzed and approached, as well as the opinion on the content relayed through the choice of genre. When scholars label these mystical texts "visionary literature", "mystical treatises" or even show the relationship to hagiography, these structural categories deny acknowledgement of all present text forms and their variations. The result is the inclination to "fit" the beguine mystical texts into an overarching genre type (such as "visionary literature"), which may or may not represent the function of the genre within the text as part of a larger dogmatic program or system. For example, Hadewijch of Brabant wrote four groupings of works, organized by genre, that depict not only her visionary experiences, but also explanations of spirituality and imitatio Christi (the imitation of Christ) within the larger discourse of salvation, suffering and a desired perfect union with divinity. Despite the fact that these writings are grouped together as a single corpus, many scholars focus on one genre group, prompting questions regarding the ways in which an individual or separate generic reading of these genres has upon a broader understanding of that genre's function within the scope of Hadewijch's entire corpus.
I argue that the question of genre is not one that can be answered with single generic categories and that the variations present in these mystic texts exists to promote and support didactic motivations running like an undercurrent beneath all of the mystics' writings. In the end, the emphasis on genre categorization is not the method that should be implemented in the close readings of Hadewijch's, Mechthild's and Agnes' works. I posit that the motivation behind the composition of the beguine mystical texts is the unifying factor that allows the reader and scholar to approach these works as a tradition. We find variation in the methodology and form used to convey their messages to the reader, from courtly lyric forms depicting the conflicting emotions of the mystical spiritual process to mnemonic landscapes organizing and mentally revisiting visionary experiences.

Mindworld and Multimodality: The Complexity of L2 German Learners' Individual Differences and Their Engagement with Audiovisual Texts
Author: Ruck, Julia
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 13424328.

Abstract: This study investigates the role of personality-based and sociocultural individual learner differences (IDs) in first-year L2 German learners' engagement with two different genres of audiovisual texts: Film Clip (fiction) and Documentary Clip (documentarian). The advantages of using audiovisual texts in L2 instruction for both culture & language learning has been widely acknowledged. However, empirical research to-date has largely ignored not only the specific forms and functions of multimodal semiotic signs in different audiovisual genres but also learners’ personality and sociocultural background, which may provide insight into their ability or willingness to engage in complex semiotic texts.
Twenty-three first-year learners of L2 German, first, completed questionnaires that collected their personality and sociocultural background and, then, watched two three-minute audiovisual texts (Film Clip and Documentary Clip) on a similar cultural topic. After each text, they completed questionnaires that gauged their engagement with the clips: (a) their self-reported foci on a variety of multimodal characteristics of the clips as well as (b) their linguistic and cultural comprehension.
Quantitative analyses showed that learners focused on different genre-specific characteristics in each of the clips and that they had more difficulties comprehending the Documentary Clip than the Film Clip. Correlation analyses of learners’ personality and sociocultural background IDs found a complex network of inter-relations between these variables as well as associations between IDs and learners’ comprehension of the two clips. Specifically, higher levels of Tolerance of Ambiguity for Language-Learning as well as being a domestic student with L1 English (as opposed to an international student with L2 English) were related to higher comprehension.
These results indicate that learners do engage with a variety of semiotic signs in audiovisual texts. L2 instruction and research, thus, need to pay more attention to the forms and functions of multimodal signs in the L2 learning process. Furthermore, more attention needs to be paid to learners’ ambiguity tolerance by choosing appropriate teaching interventions for specific learner types. Finally, students' multilingual and multicultural perspectives need to be taken into consideration by integrating teaching approaches that are inclusive to students from diverse linguistic and sociocultural backgrounds.

The Art of the Archive: Uses of the Past in the German Essay Film
Author: Hottman, Tara Allison

Abstract: This dissertation tracks the changing conception of the archive in film and media art. It examines filmmakers who reflect upon the historicity of cinema in their work and use the archive as a model for creating their essay films, video essays and installations. The four filmmakers whose work is under examination—Alexander Kluge, Hartmut Bitomsky, Harun Farocki and Hito Steyerl—have each played an instrumental role in the development of the film industry in postwar and contemporary Germany. Considered in a constellation with one another, they cover an important period of German—and global—media history, in which the forms of moving images and their mode of exhibition have diversified. New archival sources and media technology expanded the possibilities for these filmmakers to explore the contents of the German cinematographic archive and to integrate moving images from previous sources into their works. Taking their cue from Walter Benjamin's concept of history and his practices of citation, these filmmakers use montage to put films from the past into constellation with present-day film and media. Their montages unearth aspects of earlier films that were not visible in their original context and they reveal the shifting configurations between past and present in film history, illustrating the need for a non-linear film historiography.
In these works, film history and the cinematographic archive become a site of potentiality that offers alternative paths for film in the art gallery and museum, and on the Internet. Their works collectively demonstrate how essayistic practices have expanded from the essay film of auteur cinema to the video and digital essay of media artists featured in art installations and on the Internet. The evolution of these essayistic practices testifies to the essay's continued ability to function as a form that runs against the grain of commercial production. If, as some theorists argue, the bureaucratic documentation of the archive is now the primary force through which biopolitics renders life deathlike, then the archival practices exhibited by these filmmakers not only illustrate how the past might gain a functional, creative use for the present, but they also provide an example for ways in which the archive might be employed against existing forms of control. Their works illustrate the need for increased access to the archive and a democratization of who has the authority to investigate its contents and document its histories today.

Selected Problems in Germanic Phonology: Production and Perception in Sound Change
Author: Estes, George Alexander
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10815758.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation investigates three sound changes in the early history of Germanic with an approach grounded in phonetics. Historical phonology has traditionally focused on the articulatory aspects of change (e.g., Hoenigswald 1960; King 1969). However, more recent work in phonetics on sound change has emphasized the acoustic and auditory aspects of sound change, alongside the articulatory (e.g., Beddor 2009; Blevins 2004; Ohala 1981). The present work has two goals: first, to advance the state of research on the sound changes in question; and second, to show how the findings of modern laboratory phonetics can complement the study of historical phonology.
In Chapter 2, I review past approaches to sound change, as well as more recent work in phonetics. In Chapter 3, I consider OHG i-umlaut, a longstanding problem in the field. Although umlaut-type changes are common in Germanic, and other types of vowel harmony are widely attested in diverse languages, I show that by attending to all the relevant phonetic factors, the change can profitably be reanalyzed, despite the vast literature surrounding it. I conclude that OHG i-umlaut was a type of hypo-correction, and that the phonological conditions in the late OHG period, coupled with individual variation in coarticulation, conspired to form the necessary circumstances for the change to occur. In Chapter 4, I investigate the raising of nasalized mid vowels in the early Germanic dialects. This change has been well documented in the literature, but there have been very few attempts to actually explain why nasals condition the change. By surveying the articulatory, acoustic, and perceptual properties of vowel nasalization, I show that the change is best understood as an instance of hyper-correction. This model predicts the observed changes, as well as some of the variation in the change’s conditioning environment among the dialects. In Chapter 5, I evaluate two different interpretations of the orthographic sequence in Gothic. I argue that Gothic represents [&eegr;g] in all instances, regardless of etymology. The literature on this subject has generally rejected such a view, because it presupposes an earlier change of *[&eegr;g] > [&eegr; g], which many scholars have viewed as implausible. By evaluating [&eegr; g] in the light of the aerodynamic voicing constraint relative to the structure of Gothic phonology, I conclude that such a change was in fact highly plausible, thereby strengthening the argument for the single interpretation of as [&eegr;g].
Each of the analyses of the individual sound changes stands on its own, but also serves a larger theoretical goal: to demonstrate the value of the study of both phonetic production and phonetic perception to historical phonology. In each of the chapters I identify how phonetics can help solve a more general type of problem, not just the specific sound change investigated in that chapter. OHG i-umlaut, discussed in Chapter 3, exemplifies sound changes in which the basic mechanism is already well understood. The raising of nasalized vowels, discussed in Chapter 4, is an instance of a sound change where the environment has been identified, but the conditioning is not well understood. The issue of Gothic discussed in Chapter 5 raises the question of phonetic plausibility.
In Chapter 6, I review the analyses of the preceding chapters, and outline possible avenues of further research.

Kiezdeutsch, Kiezenglish: English in German Multilingual/Ethnic Speech Communities
Author: Preseau, Lindsay
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10928575.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This study characterizes the role of English in multilingual/-ethnic speech communities in urban Germany. Drawing on both existing corpus data and new data from a multimodal fieldwork study, this dissertation demonstrates that English plays a far greater role in these speech communities than has previously been recognized. I argue that this is especially true with respect to the Kiezdeutsch speech community, exploring how the social meanings and formal linguistic features of English are reflected in Kiezdeutsch (and vice-versa).
Furthermore, I explore the role of English in contact between the current wave of refugees, many of whom speak better English than German upon arrival in Germany, and pre-existing multilingual speech communities. As the older, largely Turkish-speaking population of Germans with migrant backgrounds absorbs the new refugees, many of whom speak unrelated languages and non-mutually intelligible dialects of Arabic, English has become a lingua franca both for daily communication and as a shared second language in German classrooms. Drawing on my fieldwork data collected in refugee language classrooms, I argue that understanding and navigating this new contact situation will require taking seriously the role of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) in urban Germany. Furthermore, I argue that this contact between new migrant communities and established speakers of Kiezdeutsch necessitates rethinking assumptions about Kiezdeutsch as a “native dialect” of German.
Following an overview of the study in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 summarizes the existing literature on ethnolects in Germany. I give a historical overview of the field and, ultimately, illustrate possible reasons that English has largely been ignored in this work. Chapter 3 demonstrates that English does indeed play a role in the existing data by analyzing the influence of English on data from the Kiezdeutsch corpus (KiDKo). Chapters 4 and 5 present new data from my ethnographic-linguistic fieldwork study. Chapter 4 characterizes the influence of English on the repertoires of post-migrant youth associated with the Kiezdeutsch speech community. Chapter 5, on the other hand, examines the role of English among refugee youth, arguing that English constitutes an important point of connection between post-migrant and migrant speech communities. Chapters 4 and 5, taken together, suggest the emergence of a new German-English hybrid repertoire which I term “Kiezenglish.” Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the study by offering implications of the increasing presence of English for descriptive linguistic study of ethnolects such as Kiezdeutsch, as well as for language acquisition, pedagogy and language policy.

Production and Perception of (Non-)Seriousness in German Conversation
Author: Trygstad, Brandy J.
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10936011.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Previous research using Conversation Analysis (CA) has documented the sequential features of non-seriousness (e.g., humor and jokes) in naturally occurring conversation. On the other hand, studies utilizing sociophonetic methods have analyzed data from a variety of sources, yet rarely considered non-seriousness in conversational data. There is a need to more precisely define the unique acoustic features of non-serious utterances in everyday conversations, and how these might come to bear on the ability of one’s interlocutor to accurately identify a given utterance as non-serious in order to be able to respond differentially and appropriately.
To advance our understanding of non-seriousness, this study pursues two main types of inquiry, namely, a production analysis and a perception experiment. The production arm of the study makes use of both CA and sociophonetic methodologies. Each speech excerpt was first analyzed sequentially using CA to verify its status as a non-serious utterance, and to locate a serious counterpart from the same speaker in contiguous speech immediately preceding the non-serious utterance. The excerpts were then analyzed acoustically to measure changes in speakers’ non-serious utterances from baseline serious talk. These same excerpts were later used in a perceptual experiment, allowing comparison of the acoustic analyses with responses on a survey in which participants were asked to differentiate between serious and non-serious utterances.
The production results suggest that speakers’ non-serious utterances differ acoustically from baseline serious utterances, while the results of the perceptual survey suggest that these changes are salient to participants listening to recorded conversations. In contrast to previous studies which have attempted to locate and define a set of acoustic features manipulated in a consistent way to mark non-seriousness, I show that speakers may manipulate a constellation of acoustic features in a variety of ways which may vary significantly by speaker. In other words, there may not be a singular marker of non-seriousness for all speakers. The results of this study allow us to approach a fuller understanding of the interplay between sequence and prosody, a result accessible only through the proposed combined approach harnessing the best practices of both CA and sociophonetics.

Fabricated Worlds: Textiles, Form, Narration in Stifter, Mann, Rilke, and Keun
Author: Schweiger, Franziska

ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation, Fabricated Worlds: Textiles, Form, Narration in Stifter, Mann, Rilke, and Keun argues that the novel around 1900 responds to a crisis of representation, calling into question the ability of text to mediate and depict reality. I examine references to textiles and textile practices as instances in which realist and modernist novels address their own production. I show that while these references initially appear as a metaphor for poetic production, they in fact address in a non-figurative way the technical and structural processes by which textiles and texts are produced. An investigation of the history and production processes of gauze in Stifter’s Indian Summer, satin in Mann’s Buddenbrooks, lace in Rilke’s The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, and rayon in Keun’s The Artificial Silk Girl demonstrates how textile production processes – identified by Marx and others as key to the development of capitalism – and text production can no longer draw on a stable reference point and instead become recursive.

Representations of the Machine Gun in German Literature
Author: Etherton, Ross William
Publication info: University of Colorado at Boulder, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10843636.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Representations of the Machine Gun in German Literature examines the machine gun’s technical-literary effect on early 20 th-century literature, art, and music. I argue that the machine gun’s tactical deployment and its specific technicity shape cultural documents in terms of calculated diffusion, explosive interruption, and concentrated defensive power. The dissertation opens with an interpretation of the gun’s impact on the city and on work in Bernhard Kellermann’s bestselling techno-utopian novel Der Tunnel (1913). Then I turn to Futurism’s violent desires for speed and war, considering them from the perspective of the gun’s colonial use. Against the backdrop of WORLD WAR I’s mechanized battlefields, I go on to show that the gun’s interruptive continuity propels the narrative of Ernst Jünger’s Sturm (1923). I next follow the gun’s return to the city, arguing that Hannah Höch’s photomontage Schnitt mit dem Küchenmesser mobilizes the gun as a polemical tool against Futurism. The project concludes with the gun’s proliferation during the Vietnam War. I read Jimi Hendrix’s song “Machine Gun” as a revolutionary response to the history presented in the earlier chapters.

Linking Cognition and Emotion: An Appraisal Study of Foreign Language Teacher Anxiety
Author: Goetze, Julia
Publication info: Georgetown University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10928580.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Anxiety is one of the most researched affective variables in the instructed language learning process in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Yet, existing studies almost exclusively target the student population, although research established that foreign language (FL) teachers are equally affected by anxiety in the classroom (e.g., Horwitz, 1996), leaving the emotional life of teachers severely understudied (e.g., Mercer & Kostoulas, 2018). Additionally, learner-centered anxiety research is characterized by plethora of construct definitions that originated in psychology and have often been conveniently borrowed without providing a critical examination of the underlying assumptions, thereby often leaving scientific findings incomparable across studies. In the case of (FL) teacher anxiety, a clear and theoretically grounded definition of the construct is entirely absent.
Accordingly, this study introduces a definition that is rooted in cognitive psychology, defining (FL) teacher anxiety as a distinct feeling state that results from a cognitive appraisal sequence. To explore the relationship between cognition and anxiety, the study uses a mixed- methods approach, including an online questionnaire, classroom observations, and semi-structured interviews. On the survey, 272 FL teachers in the US, Europe, and Asia rated two anxiety-provoking teaching scenarios, reporting their cognitive appraisals along six distinct dimensions, as well as the emotion(s) that characterized their feeling states. Additionally, three teachers of German as a foreign language were observed and interviewed about their experiences of anxiety in the classroom over a period of two weeks.
Quantitative findings revealed that the cognitive dimensions that form anxiety’s appraisal structure varied greatly in the strength of their relationship to anxiety in each scenario, albeit the direction of the relationship was consistent. Furthermore, anxiety’s appraisal structure was found to explain up to 50% of the variance in anxiety ratings in the survey scenarios. Qualitative findings suggest that teachers’ beliefs influence their appraisals, which leads to nuances in verbal construal of their emotional experiences. Lastly, some cognitive dimensions were traceable in the data, showing the same linguistic realizations in English and German.

Picture Books and Photo Albums: Visual Memory of the First World War in the Weimar Republic
Author: Court, Justin
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10932682.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation analyzes how photographic representations in mass-market picture books and private soldiers’ photo albums shaped memory of the First World War in Germany during the Weimar Republic. It begins with a consideration of amateur photography during the war and how soldiers organized their memory visually in private photo albums. In contrast to the general and often politicized interpretations of war in popular picture books, photo albums establish specific, personal narratives that attend to a fuller spectrum of lived experience. By considering private practices of photography, this study opens up lines of inquiry into how individuals remembered the past and offers photo albums as a counterpoint to popular Weimar-era war picture books, which differ radically in form and intent in their effort to shape collective memory. The study then considers an assortment of successful mass-market picture books published in the 1920s, including Ernst Friedrich’s Krieg dem Kriege! (1924), Deutschland: Ein Buch der Größe und der Hoffnung in Bildern, 1914–1924 (1924; introduction by Walter Bloem), the Reichsarchiv series “Erinnerungsblätter deutscher Regimenter,” “Schlachten des Weltkrieges,” and the two-volume Der Weltkrieg im Bild (1926/28; introductions by George Soldan and Werner Beumelburg), and Franz Schauwecker’s So war der Krieg! (1927) and So ist der Friede (1928). These picture books exemplify how questions of war memory tied remembrance to contemporary public debates, such as those surrounding the nature of defeat, the legitimacy of the Republic, and the future of the German nation. The study shows how authors and book editors from across the ideological spectrum mined the war’s rich photographic archive to present supposedly realistic and therefore authoritative accounts of the conflict at a time when its meaning was hotly contested and weighed heavily on the outcome of political dispute.

Language Change in Early Modern Nuremberg: A Study of Dialect Contact, Urban Vernacular Formation, and Their Sociohistorical Influences
Author: Allison, Mary Margaret
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10932659.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Located in an area bordering North Bavarian and East Franconian dialect regions, Nuremberg seems to have formed a dialect that cannot be fully attributed exclusively to one region or the other. High levels of demographic movement, and in turn those sociological factors influencing these shifts (immigration, population turnover, etc.), provided the setting necessary for the development of a unique linguistic area. This study investigates the formation and potential focusing of the Nuremberg dialect during the Early Modern Period through an in-depth analysis of Nuremberg’s diminutive suffix system. Based on modern dialects, we know that the diminutive suffixes settled out as follows: [chart omitted.]
In the midst of dialects with distinct singular and plural diminutive suffixes, Nuremberg has developed a system that does not mark the singular plural distinction. Nuremberg is located along an isogloss separating two such systems (as illustrated in the table) (Maurer 1972: 101–2). When one applies both isoglosses, the Nuremberg area forms an island. In Nuremberg’s dialect area, we see the -la diminutive suffix applied to both singular and plural forms.
Traditional grammars have focused primarily on a phonological explanation of the development of the diminutive suffixes, referring to a weakening of an original -lein suffix, but give little explanation as to why or how varying suffix systems came about (Gebhardt 1907, Renn 2009, Moser and Stopp 1978).
This study draws connections between the development of an urban dialect and sociohistorical factors, using informal correspondence as a data source. I argue that the development of the Nuremberg dialect, including its diminutive suffix system, corresponds to large population shifts. During the Early Modern Period high numbers of immigrants entered the city as a constant source of necessary population replacement and renewal. This constant renewal of the population from various areas brought with it an influx of speakers from multiple dialect areas, which had varying diminutive suffix systems. This influx provided highly heterogeneous input from which young learners had to create their own individual grammars.
This study also builds and expands upon similar extensive research done on Nuremberg dialect formation, for example Lippi-Green (1994) on the development of Nuremberg’s consonant system and Fertig (2000) on verbal inflection in early modern Nuremberg. It also follows the precedent set by studies done on koine development, for example Kerswill and Williams’ “New Town” study (2000), as well as that of Howell (2006) and Goss and Howell (2006) on the development of early modern Dutch urban vernaculars.

Unexpected Journeys: At the Crossroads of Collaborative Filmmaking and Feminist Scholarship
Author: von Petersdorff-Campen, Anne Christin
Publication info: Michigan State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10929326.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This hybrid dissertation combines collaborative, creative filmmaking and feminist scholarship grounded in German studies. The written dissertation addresses fundamental issues in feminist filmmaking—body, voice, and collaboration—and is in part conceived as a complement to the travel documentary Wanderlust, cuerpos en tránsito (2017), a bi-autobiographical account of a journey from Egypt to Germany that was co-directed and produced by the author of this dissertation and Maria Pérez-Escalá. Taken together, the two ask the question: how can we reframe the woman traveler? Chapter One focuses on Cinematography and the Body and explores embodied, intersubjective and haptic strategies to depict women’s bodies. Chapter Two focuses on Narration and Voice and makes an argument for constructing embodied voices and expressions of relationality. Chapter Three demonstrates the potential of Collaboration, Friendship and Sisterhood in women’s (bi-) autobiographical travel accounts. These elements have taken center stage throughout the pre-production, production and post-production of making Wanderlust and are explored within each chapter in a three-dimensional way. The first dimension is a theoretical-historical engagement with literature from feminist film studies, autobiographical scholarship, postcolonial theories of representation and German film history. The second dimension involves analysis of (primarily German) feminist films that grapple with questions of how to depict the female body and/or express female subjectivity through the filmic medium. The third dimension connects these first two with the film Wanderlust through an in-depth analysis and reflection of selected scenes. As an experiment in crossing cultures, borders, disciplines, and languages this dissertation presents practical examples of and theoretical insight into cross-cultural collaboration and autobiographical documentary filmmaking. In the epilogue, the wider cultural and political context of voluntary leisure travel is contrasted with other, less privileged forms of human mobility, such as migration and refugeeism, making an argument for reimagining touristic discourses in order to open up spaces for (narrative) encounters with these realities.
Appended to this dissertation are two sample scenes from Wanderlust, cuerpos en tránsito (2017). The first consists of the opening sequence, which illustrates the core issues addressed in the body of the dissertation (camera, narration, and collaboration) (opening_sequence_wanderlust.mov). The second focuses on a border crossing between Egypt and Israel and addresses the problematics of embodied, gendered travel (border_crossing_Wanderlust .mov). Information on how to access the complete film is available at wanderlustlapelicula.com.

Becoming-Ill: Chronic Illness and Materiality in Life Narratives in Contemporary Germany
Author: Herges, Katja
Publication info: University of California, Davis, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10816278.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Chronic illnesses such as cancer, dementia, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are one of the major challenges facing Western health care systems. Concomitant with the rise of chronic illness in the last decades, autobiographical narratives about experiences with chronic illness have proliferated in Western societies and occupy a prominent place in the cultural landscape today. While studies of illness narratives have mainly focused on pedagogical and narratological analysis and on texts, this dissertation examines how visual life narratives can transform medical and cultural concepts of chronic illness. Specifically, it analyzes life narratives about chronic illness by patients or their caregivers in contemporary Germany, focusing in particular on documentary, photography and comic. In Western medicine and culture, chronic illness is understood as loss or decline of health and a productive, independent and autonomous life. Drawing on three case studies, dementia documentaries, cancer photography and comics about motor disabilities, I argue that, rather than a loss, the selected works reveal how these often painful material changes allow for the possibility of transformation and becoming. This becoming occurs through recreating material and affective relations beyond the individual body. Such a conceptualization of illness transcends biopolitical philosophy and social constructivism, prevalent in literary and cultural scholarship of medicine, and insists on the entanglement of pathology with materiality and discourse. By engaging live narratives with (material) feminist theory and media studies the project intervenes in the emerging field of critical medical humanities.
The first chapter analyzes how documentaries of dementia conceive of memory loss. While medical discourse focuses on the progressive loss of cognitive function and of passivity and dependency in dementia, I argue that Marion Kainz’ Der Tag, der in der Handtasche verschwand (The Day That Was Lost in the Purse) and David Sieveking’s Vergiss mein nicht (Forget Me Not) theorize memory loss as deterritorialization from stable identities and linear time-space frameworks. Drawing on Rosi Braidotti’s concept of minoritarian memory and Karen Barad’s notion of entangled re-membering, this deterritorialization of dementia patients opens an agential process of becoming and re-membering that consists of re-creating (gendered) identities, relations or memories in the continuous present of the documentary.
The second chapter engages with photographs and (digital) life narratives about female bodies with cancer scars. While chronic illness and loss of feminine body parts such as hair and breast are linked to loss of sexuality and desire, drawing on Elisabeth Grosz and Rosi Braidotti, I argue that life narratives about sexuality and chronic illness celebrate how scars allow the emergence of multiple possibilities of (sexual) becoming while acknowledging the suffering inherent in this process. Nana Stäcker’s highly stylized portrait pictures, taken during her chemotherapy for Edwing’s Sarcoma and published in her mother's photographic memoir, and Ute Melle’s selfie blog and Amazon art book with (nude) photographs after mastectomy allow them to experiment with female performances and desires.
The third chapter analyzes comics about living with bodies that are suddenly or increasingly unable to move. While medical and cultural discourses construe immobility as loss of independence and autonomy, drawing on Erin Manning’s concept of relational movement and incipiency, I argue that these narratives theorize their disability as opening potentialities of movement through relations between bodies, spaces and technologies. Even though Reto Gloor’s graphic memoir Das Karma-Problem (The Karma Problem) about his struggle with Multiple Sclerosis and Roland Burkart’s autobiographically-based graphic novel Wirbelsturm (Whirlwind) about tetraplegia describe their experiences of dependency in daily life, they highlight how their relations with assistive devices and carers allows them to move and to draw comics in new ways.
Building on the conceptualization of chronic illness as material becoming in the previous chapters, the last chapter formulates a posthuman theory of care based on illness memoirs and diaries by first and second-generation immigrants living in Germany. Medicine focuses on how drug therapy eliminates pathological foreign agents such as cancer cells or bacteria with the goal of restoring healthy bodies. In contrast, drawing on ecomaterialist and postcolonial theory by Jane Bennett and Gloria Anzaldúa, I argue that these narratives theorize therapy and care of chronic illness as material human and non-human encounters.

A Feeling Unlike Any Other: Reactionary Rhetorics of Rechtsgefühl in Kleist, Droste-Hülshoff, and Fontane
Author: Denz, Jacob
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10750214.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The Western tradition has often assumed a simple and stark opposition between feeling and the law. This dissertation considers a different version of the relationship between law and feeling denoted by the German compound noun Rechtsgefühl. Usually translated into English as “sense of justice,” in the case of Rechtsgefühl something about the feeling itself participates in normativity on a more fundamental level than would be the case for other feelings. Such a Rechtsgefühl would be a feeling unlike any other, its origin and status transcendental rather than empirical. This dissertation argues that the development of rhetorics of Rechtsgefühl in literary and legal philosophical texts from around 1800 to the early years of a unified German state can be understood as a reaction to and against ubiquitous projects of legal codification that sought to establish a comprehensive and conclusive version of positive law. While the legal philosophical texts consider Rechtsgefühl as a basis or support for positive law, the literary texts represent it as an alternative in the absence of or in conflict with external legal institutions. The deployment of Rechtsgefühl in literary texts by Heinrich von Kleist (Die Familie Schroffenstein, Michael Kohlhaas), Annette von Droste-Hülshoff (Die Judenbuche), and Theodor Fontane (Schach von Wuthenow) constitutes a reactionary, anti-modern rhetorical strategy uniting three deeply politically conservative authors. Each holds out Rechtsgefühl as allowing for a common measure between law and feeling, a fusion or synthesis of two usually opposed substantives. Rechtsgefühl as alternative to or competitor with positive law promises immediacy as opposed to the mediation inherent in applying universal principles to particular cases. Nevertheless, each text also breaks this central promise to the reader, depicting Rechtsgefühl in its failure, dissolution, and inefficacy.

Mormonism in Nineteenth-Century German Literature: Nation, Family, and Religion on the Frontiers of America and Europe
Author: Reed, Sarah Clement
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10830544.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation analyzes fiction written about Mormons in German in the nineteenth century. Using Robert Orsi’s theory of abundant events, I place these texts into the context of German-speaking peoples, cultures, and histories, to show how politics and aesthetics work together to reveal possibilities available on the changing frontiers of Europe and America.
The first chapter looks at Amalia Schoppe’s novel Der Prophet , the first novel about Mormons. I show how it fits into the genres of Bundesroman and Amerikaroman and how it draws on portrayals of German minority religions in the US, specifically the Lutheran pastor Martin Stephan and the Saxon Lutherans in Missouri. I then explore the function of family in the text and what that reveals about German’s understanding of ethnicity and nationhood.
Chapter Two examines the novels Das Mormonenmädchen and Der Fanatiker by Balduin Möllhausen. These novels populate the American religion with Scandinavian characters who need saving from polygamous marriages. Möllhausen warns against Mormons as religious fanatics and sexual deviants who threaten the bourgeois nuclear family. In response, he constructs a German nation with colonial interests in America and Scandinavia.
In the third chapter, I consider Mormonism in Karl May’s works Unter Geiern, Die Felsenburg, and “Die Rache des Mormonen.” May, the most popular German author of all time, wrote bestselling works that feature villainous Mormons who threaten the American West with violence. I investigate how these works circulate their adaptations into other media. I also comment on the meaning of these works for Mormons today.
In Chapter Four, I inspect Sidonie Grünwald-Zerkowitz’s poetry cycle Die Lieder der Mormonin, which is narrated by a Mormon woman in a polygamous marriage who is abandoned by her husband for a new wife. I show how Grünwald-Zerkowitz creates an orientalized Mormonism to accommodate her ideas about marriage, sexuality, and women’s rights. I fit this text into contemporaneous German women’s writings and Mormon women’s writings.
In the conclusion, I summarize the relationship between Germans and Mormons in the twentieth century and offer some thoughts on the need for a more abundant history of Mormonism.

The Flipped Classroom in Introductory Foreign Language Learning
Author: Hojnacki, Susan G.
Publication info: Michigan State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10825578.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation looks at the effects of the flipped classroom model on foreign language learners at the introductory level. Specifically, the project examined students’ learning outcomes in reading, writing, speaking, and listening when exposed to the flipped classroom format for one or two semesters of introductory German classes at the college level. The study also examined learner perceptions about the flipped classroom model and the use of technology for foreign language learning in general.
This yearlong study investigated two sections of the same introductory German course during two consecutive semesters. The delivery of new content was flipped so that one course (control) received its instruction in face-to-face (F2F) lectures from the professor and completed written homework assignments outside of class time, while the other section (flipped) watched recorded online videos outside of class time and completed more interactive activities during face-to-face instruction. Each semester of the study took place in a first- or second-semester German course and measured student proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening through a placement test at the beginning and an achievement test at the end. The study also issued a survey at the end of each semester on learner perception to measure students’ attitudes about the flipped classroom specifically, and language learning through technology in general. The study set out to investigate two specific research questions. Research question #1: Does the flipped classroom delivery format result in different learning outcomes for beginning foreign language learners when compared with a control group? Research question #2: How does the flipped classroom model affect introductory language learners’ attitudes and perceptions about CALL in general and the flipped classroom specifically?
The results were mixed from the first to the second semester. For RQ#1, by the end of the first semester, 64% of the students in the flipped section reached the benchmark score on the achievement test, compared with 32% of the students in the control section. These results were approaching significance (p = .056). In the area of vocabulary learning, 57% of the flipped section and 18% of the control section achieved the benchmark score. These results show a significant effect for course design on vocabulary learning (p = .016). In all other categories of reading, writing, listening, and speaking, there were no significant differences in the percentage of learners reaching the benchmark score during the first semester of the study. In the second semester of the study, there were no significant differences in the results of the achievement test.
For RQ#2 in the first semester, students in the flipped section were significantly more likely to choose a flipped course design for their next foreign language class than the students in the control group. Students in the flipped group were just as likely to choose a flipped class as a traditional class in the future, while the control group was significantly more likely to choose a traditional class. This demonstrated the effect of placing the flipped classroom delivery format on an even footing with the traditional format in student opinion after one semester of exposure to the flipped classroom. Student retention from first semester to the second was higher in the flipped group. For RQ#2 in the second semester, the control group continued to prefer a traditional lecture format and grammar-based instruction while the flipped classroom section gave equal preference to all formats of learning including face-to-face lecture, online videos, and interactive group work.

Franz Kafka zwischen den Medien. Film- und Comics-Adaptionen des Kafka'schen Werkes
Author: Grammatikopoulos, Damianos
Publication info: Rutgers The State University of New Jersey, School of Graduate Studies, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10902064.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation, entitled Franz Kafka zwischen den Medien. Film- und Comics-Adaptionen des Kafka’schen Werkes examines adaptations of Franz Kafka’s novels and short stories with special attention given to (audio-) visual translations of The Metamorphosis, The Trial, and The Castle. The project rethinks the notion of an adaptation as something secondary and derivative by exploring the “supplementary” relationship in which the original and its translations are enmeshed. I view the adapted works as expansions of the source text that widen and complicate the meaning of the story on which they are based. In my analyses, precursor text and adaptation(s) are shown to be related in such a way that each brings out unsuspected dimensions in the other.
Drawing on materials from a diverse field of studies, my chapters investigate the reciprocal effect that source text and adaptation have on each other. Leaving aside a binary, hierarchical view between literature and film, or any other narrative media that places the literary text above its adaptation, my work treats the adapted material not as a supplementary, condensed visual transposition of an original text, but both as an independent work of art and a modification of the story on which it is based. By choosing not to view the source text as a center around which adaptations revolve, my analysis contributes to a comprehensive and extensive approach to the study of visual and audio-visual transpositions.
I argue that adaptations have the potential to add complex layers of meaning to the source text and thus change our understanding of the latter. An adaptation is essentially an interpretation and as any interpretation it has the potential to profoundly alter the text it is utilizing. As opposed to the common approach within the field of adaption studies that focuses solely on two media, usually literature and film, my dissertation incorporates a third medium: the graphic novel. While the study of literary texts that have been adapted to graphic novels is on the rise as well, my dissertation expands the field by concentrating on works that have been adapted into at least two narrative media.
Furthermore, my methodology takes into account the complexity of Kafka’s texts and the depth of its rich language. By pointing to adaptations, the rich implications of Kafka’s words and sentences become “visible” and often transform into something completely new. In my analysis, Kafka’s texts and their adaptations merge into an elaborate inter-medial narrative, making the source story more complex and fertile for subsequent interpretations. The enthusiastic response from senior scholars in related fields to my conference-presentations is an indication of the far-reaching ramifications that a reading across media can have. Furthermore, several chapters and subchapters of my dissertation are currently under consideration for publication. The last chapter on parasitism (5. Simulationen des Kafkaesken), has already been published in the journal Humanities, and the two subchapters on The Castle (2. Das Schloß) are currently under consideration for publication at the German Studies Review (2.1.2 Schwellenmotive: Fenster und Türen des Schloßes) and The German Quarterly (2.1.1 Vor dem Schloß) respectively.

Readers' Lore. Media, Literature, and the Making of Folk-lore
Author: Mandel, Hannes
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10816799.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The origin of German folk tales, folk songs, and folk legends has been thoroughly investigated by German literary studies. Unknown, so far, is the history of an offshoot of the German “Volk” concept on the other side of the English Channel. In 1846, it was the antiquary and clerk in the Printed Paper Office at the House of Lords, William John Thoms, who successfully established a neologism modeled explicitly after similar German compounds: “Folk-Lore.” Folklore, however, differs significantly from, say, the “Volksmärchen” of German Romanticism. While the latter, even after their transmutation into various degrees of “Kunstmärchen” at the hands of German philology continued to be what they had been before, i.e. recognizable material texts; it is much more difficult to determine, in the light of post-Romantic sobriety: what, after all, had been “Folk-Lore”?
The present dissertation undertakes to answer this question by investigating for the first time the material basis of folklore at the outset of its conceptual history. Contrary to all existing accounts, the concept was anything but an instant success: Rather, it was only by means of a unique and strikingly modern journal project that Thoms eventually succeeded in actuating the circulation of both folklore and its designation. Precisely where one would have expected decidedly antiquated, backward-looking forms of knowledge, one discovers in the largely forgotten amateur Thoms a technology-savvy media expert, whose journal – enabled by the contemporary innovations of the railway and the Uniform Penny Post – is strongly reminiscent of modern-day Internet phenomena (such as online communities, crowdsourcing, or user-generated content), yet predates all of them by about 150 years.
This study, however, does more than set a narrative straight. Informed by the ‘Potsdam School’ of Media Studies’ focus on “media usages,” as developed in their recent Historisches Wörterbuch des Mediengebrauchs, the dissertation offers insights into the non-linearity of the evolution of media, into the currency of anachronicity, and the affordances of tradition and innovation. It suggests that media theory cannot dispense with the constitutive dimension of media usage, and reconfirms, once more, that the New is best understood by means of the Old and vice-versa.

Romanticism Reloaded: Romantic Trajectories in Contemporary German Literature
Author: Sheedy, Melissa Ann
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10826437.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: From felines to fairytales, Grimm to Goethe, and magic to marionettes, the literatures, cultures, and philosophies of the German Romantic movement maintain an enduring influence into the twenty-first century. While Romanticism and its legacies have been broadly addressed in scholarship, this dissertation specifically traces these Romantic trajectories, both structurally and thematically, in post-Wall contemporary German fiction. With a focus on how Romantic themes, values, and mechanisms are reimagined and transformed, I consider works by Kerstin Hensel, Juli Zeh, Julia Franck, Christa Wolf, and Sabrina Janesch. My study addresses four broader categories that thematize these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century influences: the forest as a Romantic motif, witches and other powerful women as transgressors, the “in-between” figures of the doll and automaton, and intersections of violence, gender, and power. Theories of material ecocriticism, feminist narratology, and intersections of violence and gender build the frame for this study in order to identify systems of power and oppression that play a political role in these works. Victims of patriarchal oppression are systematically relegated to the negative—and thus the Other—side of arbitrary binaries: male versus female, culture versus nature, normalized versus deviant. As such, my project articulates a model of binary violence that describes patterns of violence against marginalized populations and entities. Drawing on bell hooks, René Girard, and Christine Künzel, I define binary violence as a system of brutality engendered by the power differential in relationships marked by perceived dichotomies, such as masculine versus feminine and humankind versus non-human nature. As I demonstrate, the new sociohistorical contexts in which these Romantic trajectories come to light play on reader expectations and reveal the political implications of telling a tale. Considering today’s fraught political landscape, these patterns of violence and oppression play a foundational role in contemporary discourses, and their depictions link the nineteenth century with familiar concerns and uncertainties of today.

The Romance of Love and Law: Marriage in Twelfth-Century German Romance
Author: Martin, Jonathan Seelye
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10744783.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation examines the connections between medieval marriage law and courtly romance. It argues that medieval romance functions as an integral part of the medieval legal system, and that it promulgated and promoted a certain ideology of marriage through the newly vigorous enforcement of various marriage laws in the canon law of the Church, namely: that the consent of both bride and groom is necessary for a marriage to be legally valid; that both husband and wife are to some extent equal in marriage; and that a marriage, once consented to, cannot lawfully be dissolved. The most important of these new laws is the concept of consent (consensus), upon which the other two also rely. Vernacular courtly romance played an important role in spreading this new ideology of consent, partial spousal equality, and indissolubility among the laity. At the same time, this dissertation examines the ways in which five medieval romances examine these laws in a manner resembling jurisprudence: medieval romance enables a more systematic way of thinking about the law than the previously mostly oral vernacular legal culture of the Middle Ages. I argue for this understanding of romance's role by using André Jolles' concept of the case (Kasus) as a simple form of literature: the "case" tests a law or rule against some higher principle such as justice. The romances examined in this dissertation can be shown to incorporate specific laws associated with the new ideology of marriage into their overall structure as "cases."
The dissertation can be broadly divided into two parts: the first part, consisting of two chapters, explores the role of consent in Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneasroman, Eilhart von Oberg's Tristrant, and Otte's Eraclius. The second part examines the consequences of consent to marriage: The problem of spousal equality is examined in Hartmann von Aue's Erec, and the role of indissolubility is examined in Hartmann's Iwein. All five romances are shown to support the new laws of marriage by testing and proving them in the form of "cases," sometimes in the form of multiple cases testing multiple facets of the new laws.

"Ich bin und bleibe bloß Poet und als Poet werde ich auch sterben." Friedrich Schiller's Sense of Poetic Calling and the Role of the Poetic Idea in His Emerging Professional Identity as a Dramaturge

Abstract: My dissertation, “Ich bin und bleibe bloβ Poet und als Poet werde ich auch sterben.” Friedrich Schiller and the Role of the Poetic Idea in his Emerging Professional Identity as a Poet-Dramaturge , examines how Schiller’s deep sense of poetic calling and his desire to ennoble human character informed his literary works. His conceptions of drama, early dramatic practice, and the exogenesis of his own aesthetic theories crystallized his understanding of what it meant to be a poet. Furthermore, Schiller’s studies on human physiology strongly impacted his pursuit of portraying and developing whole characters on the stage as models of human behavior in the interest of forming an efficacious society. Schiller’s main material was the human being. His study of human nature, I argue, greatly informed his poetic impulse.
This study thus explores how Schiller sought to counteract the one-sided development of human beings through his presentations of dramatic characters and their interactions. We focus, first, on theoretical conceptions of the aesthetic education of human beings and, second, the dynamic relationships that Schiller’s creative acts explore in his dramas, Die Räuber and Don Carlos. We seek to account for the sources that fed Schiller’s poetic imagination and the forces that determined the forms of his creative activities. Then trace the manners in which Schiller’s concept of the beautiful expose new interpretive perspectives, in particular how the poet’s dramatic art ennobles human character.
Methodology: Schiller dedicated himself to the creative activity of the light of his mind, his writings will guide my thoughts on this topic. Selected contributions to scholarship that relate to our topic are also consulted. We embark on a process of inquiry into the imaginative-intellectual quality of Schiller’s poetic pursuits that is both chronological and inductive in nature. Following the intuitive process that developed Schiller’s poetic consciousness, we scrutinize “sources” that fed the German author’s imagination and “forces” that guided his understanding of himself as a poet-dramaturge.
In Chapter 1, we trace Schiller’s intellectual and artistic development in the light of his writings on and his intuitive awareness of his calling as a poet. Chapter 2 delineates how Schiller began to devote himself to his profession as a poet and actualized his sense of purpose. In Chapter 3, we inquire into how Schiller developed the theoretical-practical foundation of his poetic pursuit, i.e. das Dichterische. We argue that by establishing beauty as the symbol of alliance between Geist and Sinn, Schiller schooled himself in ways that men and women experience themselves as complete, i.e., whole human beings through the medium of art.
Part II contains a discussion of Schiller’s theories of drama. Chapter 4 addresses how Schiller’s debut play, Die Räuber , engaged the sensations in and between his dramatic characters and of his audience in his endeavor to ennoble human character. By considering seriously the tragic flaw of his characters, we claim that Schiller’s purpose was to educate human beings how to negotiate either the improvement or deterioration of their state of affairs. In Chapter 5, we analyze key elements that helped to construct Schiller’s first polished (“classical”) drama, Don Carlos.
Scholarship on Friedrich Schiller: We begin and end the dissertation with Friedrich Schiller’s self-identification and prediction for the future. “Ich bin und bleibe bloß Poet and als Poet werde ich auch sterben.” Since the most recent commemoration of his death took place in 2005, we begin with some critical remarks on several book publications that appeared in that year. We remain sensitive to the state of research ( Stand der Forschung) in order to gain deeper insight into Schiller’s aspirations and accomplishments.
My study demonstrates that in pursuit of refining human beings’ capacity of feeling through the training of the faculty of sensation ( die Ausbildung des Empfindungsvermögens), it was through the creative process of writing his early dramas that Schiller began to conceive aesthetics in conceptual pairs: the naïve and the sentimental, grace and dignity, beauty and the sublime. By inquiring how Schiller’s debut play, Die Räuber, and his first classical drama, Don Carlos, expand and further form not only the faculty of the intelligence but refine the sensibilities of the heart, i.e., the sensations ( Empfindungen), I claim that Schiller’s professional identity unfolds in writing theory and creatively constructing dramas like Die Räuber and Don Carlos.

American Learners' Perceptions of the Pragmatics of German Interactions: What do Germans Really Mean?
Author: Svare, Ragnar
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2018. 10743807.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation sheds light on how learners of German, NSs of German, and Americans unfamiliar with German reach decisions about the nature of speech acts that they witness NSs of German perform in three authentic video clips. It also aims to gain a better understanding of what sources members of the three groups bring to bear when they attempt to disambiguate pragmatic information. The overarching goal is to explore whether and how learners develop the receptive pragmatic skills that they need to interpret the type of authentic L2 evidence that they are most likely to encounter, i.e., visual and auditory information contained in non-routinized speech acts in which they play an onlooker role.
The dissertation survey was distributed via Qualtrics. Video clips from German reality TV shows were first shown without and then with sound to the three participant groups. At each viewing, they rated the likelihood of the clip depicting each of five speech acts and ranked four paralinguistic cues in the order of their contribution to the ratings.
Three factors emerged as distinguishing among the participant groups: (1) the threshold for regarding a speech act as neutral as opposed to face-threatening; (2) familiarity with and attitude towards German, where NSs of German were most familiar and Non-Learners of German were least familiar; and (3) the extent to which the groups relied on respective cues to reach their decisions even in instances in which they agreed on the nature of the speech act.
I suggest two policy recommendations: 1) amend the World-Readiness Standards so as to make explicit reference to pragmatics and thereby underscore the important role that it plays in language use; and 2) is for teachers to be cognizant of the fact that when learners perceive and interpret language situations, they may not draw on the full array of available cues and may require explicit guidance.
Learners must be made aware of these complex, dynamic processes, so that they are better equipped to interpret meaning from a wide variety of sources. In theoretical terms, I suggest the use of Dynamic Systems Theory to explore L2 pragmatic development.

Artificial Aliens: Reproductive Imaginations in German Culture
Author: Orich, Annika
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10688536.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation, titled “Artificial Aliens: Reproductive Imaginations in German Culture,” studies how reproductive processes in biology and the arts evoke similar cultural anxieties, and how they, in turn, are shaped by these same fears. I view and investigate reproduction in biology and the arts as related processes, specifically those conducted via artificial means. My dissertation examines this relationship by tracing artificial aliens as a point of connection across disciplines, media, and periods. The figure of the artificial alien appears as artificial human, othered stranger, alien lifeform, and cinematic image. I develop my argument via several case studies, ranging from Weimar silent films such as Otto Rippert’s Homunculus (1916/1920) and Henrik Galeen’s Alraune (1927/1928) to Frank Schätzing’s science fiction bestseller Der Schwarm (2004) to Netflix’s original series Sense8 (2015-). I argue that there exists a complex dynamic between reproductive processes in biology and the arts and discourses on memory, identity, and media and its archaeology. This project thus contributes to existing research on the interplay between science and fiction. I argue that reproductive imaginations play a crucial role in self-conceptions of the human species. The (im)materiality of the cinematic image is key to rethinking the nature/culture divide. My project therefore highlights circulation and cross-fertilization between the sciences and the humanities.

Subjectivity in Flux: Youth in Latin American and Latino Literature
Author: Reynolds, Lauren Gabrielle Judy
Publication info: The Johns Hopkins University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 27606912.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Canonical works of Latin American and Latino/a/x fiction and film often employ young central characters that permit these works to reflect upon significant social issues. At the same time, the prevalent theoretical model used for the critical study of these novels and their young protagonists is the Bildungsroman, or the “novela de la formación” [novel of formation]. The engagement of this distinctly western model most often results in either the reading of Latin American and Latino/a/x narratives of youth as “failed” Bildungsroman or in the creation and deployment of reading strategies that permit such “failures” to be read as part of a discussion regarding regional difference.
Through a close reading of canonical narratives of youth that focuses on the characters’ distinctly liminal status, my project recognizes youth as central to a range of aesthetic projects enacted within oft-studied works of literature and film. My project focused on Rosario Castellanos’ 1962 novel Oficio de tinieblas [The Book of Lamentations] as well as her 1957 novel, Balún Canán [The Nine Guardians]; José María Arguedas’ Los ríos profundos [Deep Rivers], published in 1958; Mario Vargas Llosa’s 1967 novella “Los cachorros”; Jorge Amado’s 1937 novel Os capitães da areia [The Captains of the Sands]; Cristina Peri Rossi’s La rebelión de los niños [The Children’s Rebellion], published in 1980; Junot Díaz’s 2007 novel, The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao; Roberto Bolaño’s 1998 novel, Los detectives salvajes [The Savage Detectives]; Cary Fukunaga’s 2009 film Sin nombre [Nameless]; Fernand Meirelles and Kátia Lund’s 2002 film Cidade de Deus [City of God]; and César Aira’s 1993 novel Cómo me hice monja [How I Became a Nun]. The close reading of this corpus led me to conclude that these works utilize the liminal perspectives and voices of young characters in order to engage with the increasing fragmentation found across these distinct societies. My research further shows how institutions including the Catholic Church, the local schools, the State, and the Family, collude to delineate the possibilities within and against which youths come to define themselves. To that end, I found three principle trajectories exist for youth in these works: they may either commit to lives of social reform, recognize the failure of traditional trajectories, or occupy an immanent, as opposed to a transcendental, telos as a form of resistance acknowledging the lack of viable options.
Chapter One suggests a theory of liminality as based on readings in Cultural Anthropology which I join to a consideration of agency based on my reading of Michel Foucault and an idea of pluritopic hermeneutics taken from the works of Walter Mignolo. Chapter Two examines central institutions such as the Church, Schools, and the State, that create and normalize trajectories for youth. Chapter Three uses an idea of the “competent reader” along with an examination of social matrices to engage with young protagonists as active navigators of complex social networks. Chapter Four shows how the elimination of the transcendental telos creates communal groups that take up a semi-permanent status as liminal entities. Chapter Five functions as a literary interlude showing how questions of gender and body begin to dissolve in the liminal space of literature. Together, these chapters show how young characters function at the nexus of a complex interplay of aesthetic praxes and social restraints and how the close reading of Latin American and Latino/a/x literature works to correct an overreliance on the Bildungsroman as an approach to figures of youth in literature.

Border Poetics: Contemporary German and Polish Literary Intersections
Author: May-Chu, Karolina
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10624139.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Borders can be literal and figurative, but their effects are always real. The border between what is today Germany and Poland has been drawn multiple times over the past centuries. While these changes often did not align with people’s ethnic, local, or personal attachments, they did not necessarily generate animosities until the rise of nationalism in the modern period. Thus, for much of the twentieth century, the border was narratively constructed as a dividing line. The situation changed with the end of the Cold War, and narratives after 1989 often articulate the borderland as a site of contact and of mixing. However, at times writers and artists go beyond this transnational perspective.
This dissertation argues that some German and Polish border narratives express entangled histories and “defocalized” identities by engaging in a practice of radical de-bordering and reshuffling of border constellations. To analyze such phenomena, I adapt the concept of “border poetics” to denote a narrative and cultural practice that places historically and socially situated borders and border experiences in relation with figurative boundaries. This means that “real” borderlands become staging grounds for symbolic border crossings that represent fundamentally human experiences or questions of identity, e.g., the border between life and death, dream and reality, and interrogations of gender, race, or ethnicity. Because border poetics rests on the same productive tension between the particular and the universal that also drives cosmopolitanism, I argue for viewing border poetics as an idiom of the cosmopolitan imagination.
Instead of foregrounding border poetics as an analytical tool, my study stresses that it is a practice. In five chapters, I locate the practice in the broader history of German-Polish relations; map the phenomenon in theoretical terms by drawing on scholarship in the fields of border studies, cosmopolitanism, and world literature; and interrogate and expand the theoretical framework by testing it on specific narratives. The analysis of select literary and cultural texts focuses on story, discourse, and performance, and I show that these narratives engage in transborder conversations that do not ignore or homogenize difference, but examine it critically and imagine border spaces in new ways.

„Dieses furchtbare Doppelgängertum der Repräsentation“ Gespenstische Figuren der Souveränität zwischen 1910 und 1919
Author: Haselbeck, Sebastian
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10620965.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: In 1917, the German politician Hugo Preuß delivered a speech in Berlin on the occasion of the Kaiser’s birthday. Preuß argued that the cult of an Emperor was an anachronistic remnant of a bygone era. Yet as a concept it was strangely effective in its hold on the political imagination: World War I had shifted modern political thought away from revering the individual and directed attention to the grand, depersonalized contexts and currents of history itself. This dissertation argues that in the transitional period from monarchy to democracy between 1910 and 1919, although the monarchy was increasingly perceived as anachronistic in Germany and Austria, the idea or schema of a personified form of sovereignty occupied a powerful albeit ambiguous presence in the cultural and political imaginary. For unlike in France, there would be no violent, revolutionary rupture of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchical power until 1918. Yet the monarch’s presence was fraught, for although the Kaiser was still literally present on the political scene, the figure of the emperor was clearly perceived as a ghostly remnant of a political tradition that was out of sync with the times. The institution of monarchy had no future and lived on, already, as a cultural phantom. This ambivalent state, or to speak with Ernst Bloch, of simultaneous non-simultaneity, resulted in an outpouring of “Doppelgängers,” literary and cinematic ghostly doubles of sovereigns. These figures, wavering between what Ernst Kantorowicz influentially termed the “king’s two bodies,” are the subjects of this dissertation’s line of inquiry.
Before the democratic reforms of the postwar period, I suggest, literature and cinema became key cultural sites that registered future political changes in structures of political representation and responded to them by developing new forms of representation in which alternative models of sovereignty were articulated and developed. Literary texts furnished a reflexive space in which these models could be manipulated, resulting in new imaginary combinations and narratives in which an increasingly bureaucratic and reified political present could conflate with the remains of the monarch’s corpus mysticum. Short forms of texts like the gloss, the anecdote, or the newspaper notice, I argue, were especially suited to exploring these new forms of representation. For in these ephemeral textual genres, authors were able to shrink and condense the “anachronistic” form of the royal sovereign in ways that augmented and simultaneously dissected his new “ephemeral” representational status. The same was true in the cinema, where an incipient new world of ephemeral celluloid doubles could intersect in volatile ways with the ghostly political present of the monarchy.
The first chapter addresses this multiplicity of Imperial doubles by examining a short text by the Austrian author Bernhold Viertel. This anecdote recounts the meeting between Kaiser Franz Josef I. and Friedrich Wilhelm II. in the Kinematographentheater at the Prater in Vienna on the occasion of the First International Hunting Exhibition. Viertel’s text introduces the havoc that results when Emperors come face to face not only with each other, but also with their filmic doppelgängers and when traditional, aristocratic leisure practices like hunting are confronted with the mass culture industry. Viertel’s emphasis on ghostly doubles leads to the second chapter, of which two short texts by Franz Kafka are the subject. In the short story Beim Bau der chinesischen Mauer and the unfinished one-act play Der Gruftwächter, Kafka transforms the Habsburg monarchy into a phantom that finds itself inhabiting the emerging new institutional world of political bureaucracy. In 1915, these monarchical phantoms found a concrete form in Germany: a colossal, wooden effigy of the war hero General Paul von Hindenburg that was erected in the heart of Berlin. Dada author Hugo Ball composed a gloss about this wooden giant, into which the German public was invited to hammer nails. As Ball recounts, this curious form of an ephemeral monument paradoxically channeled fetishistic and destructive elements from the masses into a new ersatz figure of representational authority. Max Weber’s writings from the same period mark some of the best known contemporary attempts to synthesize and systematize questions of modern political structures and representations into an incipient sociological discourse. The final chapter explores the ways in which Weber construes the relationship between bureaucracy and charisma as articulated in his famous speech Politik als Beruf. In particular, the chapter focuses on Weber’s concept of charismatic leadership and Weber’s curious example of the “ingenious pirate,” a literary conceit that I argue can only exist as a cypher of anti-bureaucratic desire for charisma from the perspective of the rational, disenchanted world of the office. This set of case studies in the political imaginary of the Wilhelmine period thus moves from 1910 to 1919 via a wide variety of new literary genres and cultural practices. This variety reflects the numerous ways in which authors and spectators (not least monarchs themselves) confronted a consistent set of questions relating to modern sovereignty, but arrived at a plethora of different answers. It concludes with what I argue might characterize the symbolic end of an era: a 1919 photograph widely disseminated in the mass press of the first German president Friedrich Ebert. The photograph depicts Ebert in a swimming suit on the beach, marking what would emerge as a new, “democratic” era in the relationship between political authority and representational embodiment.

Slovene Bilingualism and German Language Contact
Author: Woods, Peter Carr

ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation addresses the issue of Slovene/German bilingualism in the province of Carinthia in southeastern Austria. The study examines the relationship between learning Slovene in the home and the ability to speak good German later in life; it is based on research conducted in the bilingual community of Bad Eisenkappel (Eisenkappel) in Carinthia. Over the course of two years (January 2013—August 2014 and June 2015), I made many trips to Eisenkappel to establish connections with the community and begin my fieldwork. This consisted of person-to-person interviews with residents of Eisenkappel, ten of which are represented in this study.
I argue that there is no basis for the claim that raising a child speaking Slovene in this community disadvantages the child by undermining the opportunity to speak German as well as those children who are raised speaking German only. My argument is contrary to both a long history of treating Slovene speakers as second-class citizens, and to the lingering perception among many monolingual and bilingual inhabitants of Eisenkappel that one must be raised speaking only German in order to be successful in mastering German.
In this dissertation I investigate the historical and cultural underpinnings of bias against the dialect of Slovene spoken in Eisenkappel, as well as against the speakers of Slovene themselves. I then draw contrasts between the dialect of German spoken in the region (Eisenkappel German) and that of the standard language taught in schools (Modern Standard German) in order to establish the two major varieties of German that inhabitants of Eisenkappel encounter. Finally, based on original data collected from my fieldwork, I analyze the similarities and differences in the speech of bilingual and monolingual speakers in Eisenkappel.
My dissertation challenges not only erroneous stereotypes envisaged for bilingual speakers in Eisenkappel or for speakers of Slovene in Carinthia at large, but also for bilingualism in border communities throughout Europe and the rest of the world. The principles of this study are applicable beyond border communities as well. This project could be replicated in virtually any community in which more than one language is spoken and there is incentive for minorities to learn the dominant language of the region or country.

Performing the Letter of the Law: The Role of Orientalist Race Theory in Kafka's Writings
Author: Toth, Adam J.
Publication info: The Pennsylvania State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 13918156.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation seeks to understand how and why selected literary works of Franz Kafka come into dialogue with and even seem to rebuke theories about “Oriental” races, particularly the Chinese and Jews, from the eighteenth and more predominantly from the nineteenth century. My dissertation brings together the subfield of philosophy called “race theory” with literary representations of racial others discussed in these theories, with a particular emphasis on the Chinese and Jews. For the purposes of this dissertation, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's Vorlesungen über die Philosophie der Geschichte (Lectures on the Philosophy of History) will serve as a representative of ideas discursively circulating between philosophical, historical, philological, and biological/ physiological traditions. Hegel maintains that the Chinese and Jews lack the freedom of thought necessary to make decisions on their own and defer to figures of authority, the Emperor for the Chinese and God for the Jews. I argue that Kafka's literary works have the versatility to expose the construction of race as a concept within race theory and by extension undermine Euro-centric assumptions made about non-European others. I defer to performance theory, in particular Brecht's notion of Verfremdungseffekt (Alienation Effect), which he formed after watching Mei Lanfang's performance of a Beijing Opera in Moscow, mediated through Walter Benjamin's redemptive reading of Kafka, and through the lenses of Judith Butler's notion of gender-performance and Tina Chen's application of Butler and Brecht in readings of Asian-American representations in literature. In the first two chapters of this dissertation I will look at Hegel's thoughts on the Chinese and Jews alongside Kafka's literary works “Beim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer” (“The Great Wall of China”), “Ein altes Blatt” (“An Old Manuscript”), “Die Abweisung” (“The Refusal”), “Das Stadtwappen” (“The City Coat of Arms”), “Abraham,” and “Das Paradies” (“Paradise”). In the third chapter I will consider the role animals in Kafka's “Schakale und Araber,” (“Jackals and Arabs”), and “Ein altes Blatt,” and “Die Verwandlung” (“The Metamorphosis”) play as both analogs to racial others and to other larger political entities. In my last chapter, I consider the role of violence and sexuality alongside the racial coding of skin color in Kafka's “Beschreibung eines Kampfes” (“Description of a Struggle”) and “In der Strafkolonie” (“In the Penal Colony”).

Foreign Writing Agency: Abbas Khider &amp; María Cecilia Barbetta Writing Towards Catharsis in German as a Foreign Language After Trauma
Author: Anderson, Katherine
Publication info: The Pennsylvania State University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 13918088.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Authors Abbas Khider and María Cecilia Barbetta both came to German as adults and have since written and published novels in German as non-native speakers of the language. While this decision to write in German as non-native authors of the language is in itself of interest, the reasons either author gave for their decision to write in German as opposed to their native languages inspired and shaped this dissertation. Both authors explained in various interviews that their debut novels could not have been written in their respective native languages of Arabic and Spanish. For Khider, writing in German allows him to build an emotional buffer between himself and the challenging events of his past; Barbetta described the language as a magic cloak, a Tarnkappe that allowed her to revisit the Buenos Aires of her memory, seemingly immune to its effects. The content of Khider’s and Barbetta’s first novels is strongly influenced by their respective experiences of dictatorship in Bagdad and Buenos Aires, experiences I have argued as traumatizing in this dissertation, in that they have a profound impact on the identity development of either author. After analyzingthe intersections of Khider’s and Barbetta’s debut novels, I have concluded that traumatic experiences serve as both catalyzing as well as figurative influences in the writing process, both initiating and shaping the writing. The writing generated takes the form of a trauma narrative, a first person account, marked by challenges to traditional boundaries between fantasy and reality and to time. Treating Khider’s and Barbetta’s novels as trauma narratives provides a context for understanding the capacity for writing to heal, or at the very least, address the symptoms of trauma. Whereas writing the narrative provides a framework for processing trauma, the process of writing in a foreign language, and writing in German as a foreign language in particular, provides perspective distance to the event, avenue for reinventing identity after trauma, and an avenue for healing play. My decision to compare and analyze Khider’s and Barbetta’s works in this dissertation was initially informed by student testimony in response to foreign language journal writing, by author interviews, and finally by the contextual factors that brought about this writing, including the controversial Chamisso Prize. In this dissertation, I bring together trauma research from the field of psychology and from literary theory to establish the contexts through which the catalyzing and formative influence of trauma on the text, the restorative capacity of the texts as trauma narratives, and finally the dynamic of foreign language acquisition in facilitating the writing and recovery processes became apparent. While the question why authors find writing in German as a foreign language preferable to writing in their native languages remains as the heart of this dissertation, pursuing the answer to this question raised further questions regarding genre and ethical responsibility.

<i>Natura Narrans:</i> Landscape as Literature in Early Modern Italy
Author: Tower, Troy
Publication info: The Johns Hopkins University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 13890002.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation uncovers literary self-consciousness in the forest settings of early modern Italian narratives, which exploit the symbolic and ecological properties of forest environments to fashion meditations on various aspects of narrative composition. The first chapter presents the etymological associations between woods, words and metaphysical generation solidified by Aristotelian commentators and applies these to the selva oscura of Dante’s Commedia. A reading of the opening forest as reflective of the poem’s still unrealized potential illuminates a sequence of metaliterary settings and throws into relief a character in the forest of suicides who seems aware both of his transformation into a poetic device and of his limited role within Italian literary history. A Dantesque pastiche tinges a haunted pine forest in one of Boccaccio’s novellas that expounds a spirit of inspired opportunism synonymous with the Decameron itself. The other narrative exploitations of the forest treated in the second chapter betray Boccaccio’s understanding of the randomness and believability necessary to hold the literary work in tension between nature and artifice, city and country, safety and danger, as emblematized by that other perennial symbol for the macronarrative, the garden. The final two chapters examine the same features of the forest in later works that imagine literary composition as a far less balanced operation. The plot of Ariosto’s Orlando furioso depends on its forest settings so much that it allows the trees to narrate its most momentous episode. By fully immersing the romance in the rhythms and vulnerabilities of the forest ecologies the author reveals the complexity and, indeed, vitality of literary worlds. Eager to clear the Ariostean woods from the morally legitimate realm of narrative poetry, Tasso devises a highly organized drama in which the forest is exploited for every material, spiritual and narrative functionality that can serve the pious and conservative hermeneutics demanded by counter-Reformation academics. Despite a lexical rigor that views trees as machines, the Gerusalemme liberata still gives room to explore the pathetic, personal potential of trees, especially those that share the poet’s name. While unique to the works containing the various forests, the four studies together trace the use of a particular construction to effect metaliterary commentary and in so doing confirm the general tendencies of early modern Italian literature, especially those concerning the complication of literary communication, through the relatively unexplored subfield of setting.

<i>Decamerons</i> without Women: The Spiritualization of Italian Literature in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries
Author: Falcone, Alyssa
Publication info: The Johns Hopkins University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 13889999.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation takes Francesco Dionigi da Fano’s 1594 Decamerone Spirituale as the prime example of the many ‘spiritualizations’ of classics of Italian literature in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The author, in an attempt to ‘repair’ the ‘sinful and deeply flawed’ Decameron, removes all female storytellers and characters and presents an exaggeratedly devout, misogynistic, anti-Boccaccian Decameron that offers no attribution to the original author among its 700-plus pages of ragionamenti spirituali. Despite Dionigi’s endeavor to displace Boccaccio’s famous work and showcase his own original, devotional writing, he essentially copies the structure and syntax of Boccaccio’s macrotext, sometimes verbatim, and sells himself as the new-and-improved Boccaccio. Apart from analyzing the text in terms of authorship, authorial identity, plagiarism, and gender and sexuality in the Counter-Reformation, I situate the Spiritual Decameron within the ‘tradition,’ or subgenre, of the spiritualizations of literature that proliferated during this period, especially in Italy, and analyze the objectives and motivations of the phenomenon.

The Subjectivity in/of Language in the Novels of Nathalie Sarraute and Claude Simon
Author: Cooper, Ioana
Publication info: The Johns Hopkins University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 13890126.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation examines the construction of subjectivity in the novels written by Nathalie Sarraute and Claude Simon in the 1950s and 1960s. This work inquires how Sarraute and Simon convey subjectively lived experience into written expression. I argue that for both authors writing is a way to explore experiences with the world and to recreate that experience in language, two seemingly different realities. While the subjective experience formed at the contact of the “subject” with the world is pre-conceptual, language is perceived as antithetical to sensible experience. Organized according to certain rules and used by the highest levels of consciousness, language manifests itself as an exterior reality that needs to be appropriated and transformed so as to materialize the subjective reality and make it meaningful.
A close analysis of chosen texts allowed for the distinction of three aspects that contributed to the possibility of conveying such subjective aspects formed at the encounter with the world in language. Julia Kristeva’s understanding of the notion of “semiotic” helped define the first aspect which refers to those pre-reflective elements that make their way into language through a specific form of writing. Both authors use various techniques such as figurative language, rhythm, or punctuation to recreate sensations and affects in poetic language. The second aspect refers to the presence of subjectivity within articulate language. Reading these texts with Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology of language in mind helped identify how subjectivity is constructed through content. Without a language to embody such subjective experiences with the world these encounters would remain on the level of vague and dormant sensations. It is only through writing that these experiences gain signification. Yet, the potential for signification within individual texts would itself remain latent, were it not for its actualization by the reader. Thus, approaching these novels through the lens of reader-response criticism, particularly Wolfgang Iser’s phenomenology of reading, helped define the third aspect: the reader’s contribution to the rendering of subjectivity. Sarraute and Simon wrote with the active contribution of the reader to the imaginative construction of the world of their texts in mind.

Emil Franklin Rüdebusch: Ein deutsch-amerikanischer Autor zwischen Anarchie und Sexualreform
Author: Schaupp, Jürgen
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10623881.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation investigates the background and contributions of the German American Emil Franklin Rüdebusch (1861–1940), whose significance as one of the advocates of free love, anarchy, sex reform, and woman’s emancipation has remained unappreciated. It also analyzes Rüdebusch’s four published works: Freie Menschen in der Liebe und Ehe (1895), The Old and the New Ideali (1896), the novel Die Eigenen (1903), and the collection of aphorisms Lebt die Liebe! (co-authored by Helmar Lerski, 1905). Rüdebusch’s stance against marriage laws and the traditional family, as well as his advocacy for contraception, new morals, and liberal sexual relationships, attracted the attention of American authorities in 1897; and he was arrested, tried, and convicted under the Comstock law.
Doing away with Christian values and proclaiming a New Ideal based on a Nietzschian Revaluation, Rüdebusch sees humans as cooperative by nature and posits a utopian society whose operation resembles Kropotkin’s ideas of mutual aid and assistance. Although not advocating revolutionary actions himself, Rüdebusch articulates views on sexually and politically autonomous individuals as well as sexual and intellectual friendships, which are compatible with those of individualist anarchists.
Divided into five chapters, the dissertation begins with an introduction to Emil Rüdebusch and the topics that captivated him (Chapter 1) and then provides an in-depth analysis of Rüdebusch’s four books (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 situates Rüdebusch’s ideas within a larger historical context, showing how Rüdebusch appropriated and developed ideas of John Stuart Mill, Max Stirner, and Friedrich Nietzsche to propose a new humanity based on the autonomy of the self. Chapter 4 explores Rüdebusch’s relationship to contemporaneous anarchists, sex-radicals, and feminist reformers. Friends of Rüdebusch and his wife Julia (née Sternberger) included Emma Goldman, Robert Reitzel, and Reitzel’s anarchist friends in Detroit; and Rüdebusch maintained connections to Martin Drescher, Moses Harman, Helene Stöcker, George Bedborough, and the Legitimation League in London. Chapter 5 summarizes the core ideas and argumentation from Rüdebusch’s four books and presents a more complete picture of his goal: to create a cautious utopia based on the notion that people are intrinsically good.

Resonances in Middle High German: New Methodologies in Prosody
Author: Hench, Christopher Leo
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10682162.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: For years, scholars of medieval German have grappled with how to analyze formal characteristics of the lyric and epic poetry while taking into consideration performance, musicality, mouvance, linguistic variation, and aggressive editing practices. The scholarship has justifiably resorted to restricted explorations of specific texts or poets, or heavily criticized region-specific descriptions with several caveats. The many challenges this multifaceted poetry presents has also obscured one of its most central features—the medieval voice. With the little evidence we have often being ambiguous or contradictory, how are we to understand the role of the medieval voice in the German corpus as a whole? This project seeks to shed light on this forgotten aspect by taking advantage of computational methods to demonstrate relative formal and thematic relationships based on sound and voice. In doing so, it presents several new prosodic analytical methods.
The first chapter of this project underlines the importance of sound and voice to medieval performance and composition. It additionally justifies the syllable as the foundation of the novel formal methods presented in the following chapters. Chapter two presents a new syllabification algorithm that combines two linguistic principles: the Sonority Sequencing Principle and the Legality Principle. This algorithm is then customized and computationally implemented to perform accurately on medieval German across dialects and editing practices. Chapter three employs this syllabification algorithm to characterize different phonological soundscapes in reference to theme and voice using a modest corpus of only medieval German lyric poetry. While chapter three intends to quantify the vocal affect of a soundscape, chapter four aims to account for the sequencing of these soundscapes within the larger text and corpus. Chapter three therefore lays the foundation for a structural model of medieval German form. Finally, chapter five reduces the corpus once again to a very small subset of medieval German Vierheber (epic poetry with four stresses per line). It presents a supervised machine learning model to predict scansion for these texts according to the theory proposed by Andreas Heusler, and draws conclusions from how different poets took advantage of the freedom this structure allowed.
In each chapter, I present the aggregate statistics to confirm and supplement our knowledge of the medieval German corpus as a whole. Yet more importantly, I return to individual texts in order to demonstrate how these newly discovered formal soundscapes manifest and function within a smaller narrative. This combination of “distant reading” and “close reading” supports my overarching argument that medieval German form and content were demonstrably and quantifiably highly intertwined. In many cases markedly different formal, phonologically-influenced structures were implemented to trigger connections to related texts and formats. This project thus creates a new understanding of intertextual relations in medieval German literature.

In Search of Lost Experience: Hermann Broch, Robert Musil, and the Novels of Interwar Vienna
Author: Lambert, Richard M., III
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10637377.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Characterized by themes of negation, fragmentation, and destruction, the novels of interwar Vienna are canonically read as a testament to the social and political shifts that reshaped Central Europe after the turn of the twentieth century—the upheaval of the fin-de-siècle, the devastation of WWI, and the fall of the monarchies. These canonical readings deny the modernist novel any sort of productive capacity. My dissertation, In Search of Lost Experience: Hermann Broch, Robert Musil, and the Novels of Interwar Vienna delivers a corrective to conventional understandings of the late modernist novel by pushing beyond this lament of crisis. In the Viennese interwar novels of Hermann Broch and Robert Musil, I locate a deeper agenda in the late modernist novel—the resuscitation of experience—which evidences the pinnacle of another Viennese modernism located around 1930.
My dissertation examines the Musil’s Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törleß (1906) and Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (1930/32) and Broch’s Die Schlafwandler (1930) and Die unbekannte Größe (1932). I read these novels together with theories from philosophy, psychology, and science studies that range from Kant to Dilthey, Lukacs, Mach, Freud, Neurath, and Wittgenstein in order to investigate literature’s unique purchase on experience by reawakening language as use, production, non-semiotic communication, and literary experimentation. This alternative to the standard accounts of modernism contrasts against the celebrated Viennese fin-de-siècle , and frees interwar Viennese literature from the pneumatic literary-historical narrative of crisis that has defined scholarship on twentieth century Austrian literature since Claudio Magris (1966) and Carl Schorske (1980), which frame Viennese interwar literature as backward-looking reactions to the political, social, and linguistic crises of the pre-WWI era. My dissertation instead asserts that the search for experience designates these novels as productive sites of aesthetic and cultural orientation during the interwar period.

Religious Conversions in Nineteenth-Century Germany: Clemens Brentano, Georg Buechner, and Heinrich Heine

Abstract: Friedrich Nietzsche was not the first German author to declare that God was dead, as stated famously by the madman in Die fröhliche Wissenschaft (1882): ''Gott ist tot! Gott bleibt tot! Und wir haben ihn getötet!'' Nearly fifty years earlier, Heinrich Heine had declared God dead in his essay Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland (1834): ''Unsere Brust ist voll von entsetzlichem Mitleid — es ist der alte Jehova selber, der sich zum Tode bereitet'' (HSA 8:191). He claimed that Immanuel Kant had initiated “eine geistige Revoluzion in Deutschland” (HSA 8:191) with his Kritik der reinen Vernunft (1781), an irreversible “Bruch mit der Vergangenheit” (HSA 8:191) that meant the downfall of deism. Although Heine would later disavow this claim, he was firm in his belief during the 1830s that God was dying, if not dead already, and that Kant had been the catalyst for the collapse of deism. Bruno Hillebrand has noted that declarations of God’s death such as Nietzsche’s were not new in 1882, but they were in fact ''neu erlebt'' and ''umfassender in ihrer Konsequenz.'' Between the writings of Kant and Nietzsche was a period in which the old religious institutions struggled to find a new role in a society that was radically changing. While these institutions sought renewal and transformation, so did believers on an individual level, as they began to see religion as a private choice that was meant to address their personal needs and reflect their personalities. Belief in God, or in any specific version of a god, was no longer a public and obligatory aspect of one’s identity, but simply one option among others. This created a larger number of religious seekers, the natural consequence of which was conversion in its myriad forms: for example, from one mainline religion to another, from orthodoxy to heterodoxy, or from apathy to complete devotion. This dissertation argues that the early nineteenth century was a time of conversion in Germany by investigating the constellation of theological, philosophical, and political factors leading up to the time in which three of the most notable converts of this time — Clemens Brentano, Georg Büchner, and Heinrich Heine — grappled with the notion of conversion, not only in their personal writings such as correspondence and memoirs, but also in their literary works. These three authors are only a few examples of the many conversions that began during German Romanticism, one of the most famous of which was Friedrich Schlegel, who turned to Catholicism in 1808. Goethe described Schlegel’s conversion in a letter to Karl Friedrich Reinhard on 22 June 1808 as a ''Zeichen der Zeit,'' referring to the many other converts to Catholicism during this time: Friedrich Leopold Stolberg, Adam Müller, Zacharias Werner, Clemens Brentano, Johannes and Philipp Veit, and Johann Friedrich Overbeck, just to name a few. But this ''Konversionsbewegung,'' as described by Winfried Eckel and Nikolaus Wegmann, was not limited to Catholicism. This dissertation uncovers the underlying historical and intellectual conditions during the beginning of the nineteenth century that created an environment that was highly conducive to conversions in all directions.
The first chapter explores the diverse definitions of conversion and secularization in the fields of sociology, psychology, theology, and history. Specifically, it addresses contemporary studies in conversion conducted by Lewis R. Rambo, William Bainbridge, John D. Barbour, Heinz Streib, and Charles Taylor. Each of them approaches the religious shifts represented by conversion and secularization in a slightly different way, and a synthesis of these definitions will lead to a working definition to be used throughout the dissertation: Conversion denotes a reorientation of religious affiliation (switching religions or denominations) or a transformation of religious identity (a change in religious role or a dramatic intensification of belief) with characteristics that can fall anywhere along the spectrums of gradual to instantaneous, passive to active, private to public, coerced to voluntary, and emotional to intellectual. This definition is intentionally broad because conversion is ultimately a personal experience that is unique to each religious seeker. Deconversion is a special type of conversion, and shares many characteristics with the concept of conversion in the traditional sense. Deconversions can occur on their own, or as part of a larger deconversion and reconversion process resulting in reaffiliation with another religion. The chapter addresses the concept of deconversion in some detail, as outlined in studies by John D. Barbour and Heinz Streib. The relatively new term ''deconversion'' is a necessary replacement for older discriminatory terms such as ''apostasy'' and ''defection.''
Secularization is defined in this chapter as the phenomenon in which religion became a private rather than a public affair, a shift from ''traditional religion'' to ''individualized religion,'' as Steve Bruce has suggested. Secularization is not simply the decline of religion, but rather a change in how religion is practiced. And according to Charles Taylor in A Secular Age (2007), secularization is ''a move from a society where belief in God is unchallenged and indeed, unproblematic, to one in which it is understood to be one option among others." This can be traced in the difference in the reactions to writers who were critical of Christianity as time progressed: Reimarus did not dare to publish his Apologie oder Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes (1768) during his lifetime in the mideighteenth century, but by the early nineteenth century, Strauss and Feuerbach had the courage to publish theirs. They did, however, pay the price for their unorthodox writings in their severely damaged reputations and careers and were ostracized by the academic and theological communities. By the time Nietzsche continued this demythologizing process by declaring God dead through the mouth of his madman in 1882, he did so in a religious environment that had radically changed from the beginning of the nineteenth century: one in which religion was one option for guidance among others, rather than being the dominant, unproblematic source of authority. God was still alive, but his characteristics had changed; he was no longer the source of ultimate authority and the sole bestower of meaning and purpose in human life. In this sense, it was not only individuals who underwent conversions during the nineteenth century, but the concept of God itself had been transformed as a result of the shifting Zeitgeist that sustained him. At the same time that conversions took place in great numbers on an individual level, the concept of God itself was undergoing a conversion in this process of secularization. This phenomenon is symptomatic of modernity, which Eckel and Wegmann define as ''den Zerfall übergreifender holistischer Weltbilder, Prozesse der Partikularisierung und Pluralisierung, diskursive oder systematische Differenzierung, zugleich aber auch […] eine wachsende Freiheit für das Individuum, seinen Weg in einer unübersichtlichen Welt selbst zu bestimmen.'' In this sense, modernity and conversion go hand in hand: the combination of religious pluralism and individual freedom to explore religious options is the ideal environment for a conversion.

Autonomie und Kreatürlichkeit: Hunde in der Literatur der Goethezeit und der Moderne
Author: Kassner, Jonathan

ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation explores the poetological dimension of animal metaphors in German literature in the wake of classical 18th-century aesthetics. It claims that dog figures in the literature around 1800 and 1900 are poetic devices used to counter the aesthetic ideology of autonomy via their creatureliness. While aesthetic theory from Winckelmann to Hegel excluded human animality from the arts in the name of spiritual autonomy, literature reintroduces creatureliness into its poetological reflections by means of dog metaphors and metonymies. The dissertation traces and analyzes this poetic articulation of a creaturely aesthetics in the works of Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Jean Paul, Franz Kafka, and Thomas Mann. Between the late 18th century and the early 20th century, philosophy and the sciences radically change the way humans perceive their place in the world vis-à-vis other animals, leveling out the traditional rigorous dualism within Western religious and philosophical ontology. The literary works that are studied here correlate with this philosophical development in that they figuratively verbalize a post-metaphysical ontology in which the liminality of dogs between nature and culture mirrors the position of humans who rediscover their animality. This rupture in the ontological tectonics of Western thought has consequences for an aesthetics premised upon the transcendental subjectivity of the creative mind and the autonomy of its works. In Goethe's writing, it is "demonic" creatureliness that counters the idealistic humanism to which he otherwise adheres. Jean Paul, on the other hand, employs dog tropes in his novels to satirize idealist thought; this humorous play on idealist doctrines prepares the ground for modernist authors like Kafka and Thomas Mann to pursue a more serious poetic rendering of creaturely ontology and aesthetics. Their use of dog figures links arts and creatures no longer as opposites but as elements essentially intertwined in "creaturely expression."

Literary Potions and Poisons: Schiller, Goethe, Kleist
Author: Hollender, Kurt
Publication info: New York University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10600564.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: “Literary Potions and Poisons: Schiller, Goethe, Kleist” examines the peripheral yet central literary potions and poisons in Kabale und Liebe, Faust. Eine Tragödie, and Die Herrmannsschlacht. The potions and poisons in these dramas are read as privileged tropes that thematize contemporary political and social currents and reflect poetologically on the texts. Closely considering the potions and poisons offers new readings that stand in conversation with and sometimes in opposition with some of the most renowned scholarly pronouncements on these prominent texts. A tropology of Pulver in Kabale und Liebe, the Zaubertrank and the metaphor of thirst in Goethe’s Faust. Eine Tragödie, and the mysterious Alraune in Kleist’s Die Herrmannsschlacht undergird the poets’ considerations and critiques of absolutism, bourgeois norms, the French Revolution, and the formation of nations as well as their reflections on genre, form, and rhetoric.

The Poetics of Affirmative Fatalism: Life, Death, and Meaning-Making in Goethe, Nietzsche, and Hesse
Author: Barto, Jacob Matthew
Publication info: University of Oregon, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10623455.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: The fundamental role that tragedy has played in the development of European philosophy and, by extension, psychology, has in part been due to its inextricability from an understanding of human life, facilitating its many transformations alongside major shifts in the political and social landscapes where it plays out. This dissertation draws a thread from the traditions of tragedy and German Trauerspiel through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, focusing on the legacy of the tragic as it lived on in Nietzsche's psychological philosophy and was taken up by Hermann Hesse in his literary explorations of spiritual development and the fate of the German soul. Affirmative fatalism is the conceptual name for a tendency that I observe specifically in German literature from the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, finding its clearest articulations in Goethe’s Faust and Nietzsche’s amor fati, and then becoming thematized itself in Hesse’s Glasperlenspiel. This study illustrates how ultimately in Hesse’s texts the sharp distinction is drawn between affirmative fatalism in its authentic sense – a love of and dynamic engagement with fate – and the passive fatalism of authoritarianism – a prostration before a prescribed fate, the obsequiousness of which is veiled in the language and pageantry of patriotic heroism.

Learning a Foreign Language as "Strategy": Attitudes of Learners of "Strategic" Languages (Arabic and Persian) and of Local Heritage Languages (Danish, Norwegian, Swedish) toward Foreign Language Communities
Author: Mirsharifi, Fatemeh-sadat

Abstract: This dissertation is part of a larger mixed-methods study that investigated the attitudes of American college learners of “strategic” less commonly taught languages (LCTLs), specifically Arabic and Persian as well as of local heritage languages, i.e., Scandinavian languages (Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish) at a large public Midwestern research university in the United States. A total of 67 students (15 learners of Persian, 19 learners of Arabic, and 38 learners of Scandinavian languages) participated in the study.
The dissertation explored: (1) how students of the mentioned languages described foreign language (FL) communities, specifically native speakers (NSs), cultures, and countries related to their respective foreign languages; (2) the role that students’ attitudes and imagination played as learners chose to affiliate or not to affiliate with FL communities.
Results revealed that in all three language groups the majority of respondents held positive attitudes toward the respective NSs, cultures and countries. Students of Arabic and Persian were attuned to the political importance of their respective FL whereas students of Scandinavian languages were particularly aware of – and in many instances admired - governmental and social structures in Scandinavian countries. All learner groups held positive attitudes toward NSs of their respective FL although learners of Persian were comparatively less familiar with Persian NSs and require help to generate an Ideal L2 Self in terms of the target-language community. Also, all learner groups tended to reproduce common discourses when they described particular qualities of the NSs and culture of their FL, which indicated a lack of complexity and depth in their perceptions and a need for real-life interactions with TL communities.

We Talk German Now Yet: The Sociolinguistic Development of Voice Onset Time and Final Obstruent Neutralization in Wisconsin German and English Varieties, 1863-2013
Author: Litty, Samantha Marie

Abstract: This dissertation integrates methods from historical sociolinguistics and sociophonetics to forge a new, unified approach language change analysis. I undertake historical sociolinguistics using original, handwritten data coupled with social information to make generalizations about how German and English developed in Wisconsin. I engage in sociophonetics through acoustic analysis of personal interviews and audio recordings made in the same geographic areas in the 1940s and 2013. By integrating these data types, I show how German and English came into contact, impacted each other, and how this led to the emergence of Wisconsin German and English varieties.
I use five collections of documents from the Upper Midwest to track written representations of two phonological features–voice onset time (VOT) and final obstruent neutralization (FON)–from the mid-19th century to the 1940s. Texts were collected, transcribed and analyzed to create unique sociolinguistic profiles for each author. These profiles support further linguistic analysis by linking authors to particular dialect regions. Texts were transcribed and marked for vernacular forms, which were compared with expected regional or language-specific variants. For example, one German-English bilingual author writes ticked instead of ticket, suggesting that this speaker neutralizes the distinction between /t/ and /d/ in syllable-final position. These data were then compared with the acoustic analysis of audio recordings, which I analyzed according to sociolinguistic factors such as age, sex, occupation, generation, and language status (i.e., mono-/bilingual).
This research shows that historical writings can directly inform our understanding of modern speech patterns and demonstrates how language developments before audio recordings can be inferred. Because it bridges the gap from historical to contemporary settings, this approach can be applied to historical language contact situations and it can serve as a model for investigating other communities where multiple languages remain in contact over multiple generations. This is especially important today because many of the world’s increasingly mobile bilingual communities are in contact with one another. By understanding the development of speech patterns over time and in connection to sociolinguistic factors, we can better understand the changing relationships between language and identity in bilingual communities.

Linguistic Attitudes on the Use of the Magdeburg Regiolect
Author: Tabisz, Christopher
Publication info: The University of Wisconsin - Madison, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10633488.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Linguistic Attitudes on the Use of the Magdeburg Regiolect This dissertation analyzes attitudes and perceptions of regiolects regarding the Magdeburg, Berlin, Leipzig and Standard German. Consultants listened to four recordings – one in each linguistic variety – and answered questions. The questions opened with the consultants’ personal connection to each variety and opinions of the variety itself before creating a mental image of the physical appearance and the personality of the speaker in each recording. The final section elicited the consultants’ attitudes about careers that would be best and worst suited for the speakers of the four linguistic varieties as well as provide an estimate of their education levels. The qualitative and quantitative data show a connection between the supposedly appropriate careers for standard and non-standard German speakers and whether Germans speak standard or non-standard varieties. The interviews also indicated that the level of education might be connected to which linguistic variety a person speaks. However, there is a set of careers requiring a social component, such as nursing or local radio broadcasting, that the interviewees believe to be well suited for speakers of non-standard varieties. The data indicate that speakers of the non-standard varieties in Magdeburg, Berlin and Leipzig can connect more easily with the general public of their cities and that the non-standard varieties themselves can create that proximity to the local population. Overall, Standard German seems to be correlating with higher education and a wide range of professions yet perhaps less social or friendly, whereas the use of regiolects of Berlin and Leipzig, which seem to be acceptable in more social settings. However, the Magdeburg regiolect speaker seems to be perceived negatively in both professional and more private settings.
This dissertation contributes to a body of knowledge that can help scholars and the general public understand connections between an individual’s speech and linguistic prejudices that can, for example, influence their career path. Research in perceptual linguistics, including this dissertation, can inform educational policies regarding language in schools as well as which professions a speaker may be employed in.

Queer Kinships and Curious Creatures: Animal Poetics in Literary Modernism
Author: Hoffmann, Eva
Publication info: University of Oregon, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10288670.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation brings together prose texts and poetry by four writers and poets, who published in German language at the beginning of the twentieth century: Hugo von Hofmannsthal (1874-1929), Franz Kafka (1883-1924), Rainer Maria Rilke (1875-1926), and Georg Trakl (1887-1914). All four of these writers are concerned with the inadequacy of language and cognition, the so called Sprachkrise at the turn-of-the-century. In their texts, they challenge the ability of language to function as a means of communication, and as a way to express emotions or relate more deeply to the world. While it is widely recognized that this “crisis of identity” in modernist literature has been a crisis of language all along, I argue in my dissertation that the question of language is ultimately also a question of “the animal.” Other scholars have argued for animals’ poetic agency (e.g. Aaron M. Moe; Susan McHugh), or for the conceptual link between the “crisis of language” and the threat to human exceptionalism in the intellectual milieu of the early twentieth century (Kári Driscoll). My dissertation is the first study that explores the interconnection between Sprachkrise, animality, and the phenomenological philosophy of embodiment. Drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy of phenomenology, I illustrate how Hofmannsthal, Kafka, Rilke and Trakl invoke the body as intertwined with animals in complex ways, and employ these animal figures to reconceptualize notions of language and specifically the metaphor. The authors, I argue, engage in a zoopoetic writing, as other forms of life participate as both symbolic and material bodies in the signifying processes. Moreover, I illustrate how their zoopoetic approach involve forms of intimacy and envision figures that fall outside heteronormative sexualities and ontologies, making the case for a queer zoopoetics in Modernist German literature.

Hearing with the Body: Poetics of Musical Meaning in Novalis, Ritter, Hoffmann and Schumann
Author: Smith, Alexis B.

Abstract: The question of whether or not music can be considered a universal language, or even a language at all, has been asked for centuries—and indeed, it is still being addressed in the 21st century. I return to this question because of the way the German Romantics answered it. Music becomes embodied in not only human language in Novalis’ concept of Poesie in “Die Lehrlinge zu Sais” (1802), but also nature and the human body in Johann Wilhelm Ritter’s scientific speculations in Fragmente aus dem Nachlasse eines jungen Physikers (1810). Seen as the manifestation of the world soul, this embodiment was an attempt to come closer to naming the unnamable, and, I argue, became the perfect platform for E.T.A. Hoffmann to develop his pseudonym and literary character Johannes Kreisler and the mysterious power of music he experiences in the collection of musical critiques and essays, Kreisleriana (1810–1814), and the novel, Lebens-Ansichten des Katers Murr (1819/1821). Finally, I argue that Hoffmann’s musical literary style can be heard and ‘felt’ in Robert Schumann’s piano cycle, Kreisleriana, Op. 16 (1838), as other scholars have also analyzed, but that there is also a ‘mixing of discourses’ involved, including Schumann’s own words about the suite. Music is not a universal language—at least, not as understood by the mind and described through words. These writers and composer grapple with the observation that music has a powerful influence over the body—can music then be seen as a ‘language’ received and understood by the body? If so, can an interdisciplinary approach to music and language through science lead to better understanding, as was already exemplified by the collaboration among the German Romantics? This dissertation includes previously published material, which has been substantially revised and updated.

Mediated Memory: Visual Culture and Prosthetic (Re)Memory in Post-War German Culture
Author: Becirbegovic, Amila
Publication info: University of California, Davis, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10284370.

Abstract: This dissertation asks: how do contemporary generations remember the Holocaust and what role do media play in post-WWII cultural memory construction? This dissertation examines how contemporary generations remember the Holocaust through literature, comics, film, music and cabaret performances and investigates what impact popular post-WWII visual remediation has on current genocides. It addresses how images and popular representations affect genocide memory and what potential these representations hold for mobilizing intervention in humanitarian crises, such as during the Bosnian war in the 1990s and the current refugee crisis in Germany.
Genocide has become a recognizable meme for contemporary audiences through the recycled memory—or (re)memory—of the Holocaust, resulting in a hyper-mediated form. From Art Spiegelman’s Maus (1991) and Serdar Somuncu’s cabaret performance Hitler Kebab (2006) to the portrayal of generational memory in Jenny Erpenbeck’s novel Heimsuchung (2008) and Barbara Yelin’s comic Irmina (2014), the (re)memory of Holocaust signifiers aids in seeing the past through the lens of the present. Through the hybridized remediation of historical referents this dissertation examines how the contemporary viewer experiences the Holocaust, resulting in a more socially complex view of genocide as a shared cultural memory among audiences who vary greatly in ethnic, cultural and generational background.
Chapter one begins with an overview of post-WWII identity politics and views memory through the lens of Heimat (home) and place memory. The chapter addresses the questions what it means to be German after Hitler and Germany’s National Socialist past through twentyfirst century literary intervention in the form of both fiction and memoir. Jenny Erpenbeck’s novel, Heimsuchung, and Gisela Heidenreich’s memoir, Das Endlose Jahr, address WWII memories through the trope of the family, as well as through palimpsestic places that inhabit multiple generational memories, retelling the experiences of grandparents, parents and their children, as they dig deep into the family archives to uncover and come to terms with Germany’s fraught past.
Chapter two begins with an historical overview, tracing the origin, style and subject matter of early German comics to more contemporary comic representations. The chapter addresses how comics approach the memory of the Holocaust and WWII, outlining comic intervention during the war, as well as in the immediate post-war period, leading up to German reunification. The focus shifts to a more detailed investigation of comic representations dealing specifically with the Holocaust and WWII since German reunification. Isabel Kreitz’s Ohne Peilung, Reinhard Kleist’s Der Boxer, and Barbara Yelin’s Irmina visualize war and depict traumatic memories by retelling the experiences of children, parents and grandparents through the family narratives that are passed down to them. The central question of this chapter is how contemporary generations remember through comics and explores how comics invited the reader to participate imaginatively in the genesis of creating a moving narrative out of a series of still images.
Chapter three outlines how migrants engage with Germany’s WWII past, while coming to terms with their own history, identity and place within German society. The experiences of Turkish and ex-Yugoslavian refugees and migrants, as multi-ethnic minorities, involve them in many of the larger issues, such as cultural diversity and Islamophobia, which are at the heart of Germany’s current refugee crisis. Turkey and Yugoslavia represent both the Muslim and non-Muslim migrant experience and are significantly reshaping contemporary German culture, from TV and films, to radio, music, fashion, and food. These migrants are also changing the terms of German memory culture in complex ways by engaging with the German past, which can be unsettling at times, but is also productive for the future. The chapter offers a new perspective on issues of German identity and the evolving discourses on Holocaust and genocide memory by building on established authors like Rafik Schami, Zafer Senocak and Feridun Zaimoglu’s work on Muslim migrants in Germany, as well as Turkish cabaret performers, Şinasi Dikmen and Mussin Omurca’s cultural commentary on assimilation. These influential artists have opened the door for contemporary contributions from authors, musicians and artists like Serdar Somuncu, Goran Paskaljević, Edo Maajka and Danko Rabrenovic. The texts, films, cabaret performances and musical productions engage with two histories simultaneously; with the history of Germany during and after WWII and with the histories of Turkey and Yugoslavia. This historical entanglement sheds new light on what it means to be a German today by involving the voices of migrants in the telling of Germany’s past, present and future.

Grillparzer, the Enlightener: Displaced Paternity in Grillparzer's Works
Author: Chapman, Stephanie Fritsch
Publication info: University of Oregon, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10289430.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: It is my intention to bring to light nuances of Grillparzer’s work that reflect the ambivalent conflation of formal and stylistic elements of the Enlightenment and the Baroque, which, in turn, foreshadow the continual displacement of both paternity and the patriarchy in the decades following the French Revolution. I define “ambivalent conflation” as follows: a fluctuating, sometimes contradictory approach toward a set of concepts that are brought, simultaneously, into unity and opposition with one another. This is symptomatic—at least in part—of Grillparzer's attempts to reconcile elements of the Baroque dramas after which he fashioned much of his work with his own idealism of Enlightenment ideologies, and, particularly, with Lessing's humanism and his position regarding religious tolerance. The subtle variations on the theme of paternal displacement manifest themselves in the following ways: 1) fathers who serve as such either through namesake, mentorship, or ideological and intellectual inspiration; 2) father figures who exist as such through extended family relationships, such as the figure of the father-in-law; and 3) father figure representations that exist in dream symbolism. In many of Grillparzer’s lyrical works as well as in his novellas and dramas, these forms of paternal displacement mirror conflicts and issues in Grillparzer’s own life, including his emotionally symbiotic relationship with his mother, his obsessional personality traits, and his prescient reflections on topics that would become central to modern psychoanalysis.

Alexander von Humboldt and Transcultural Memory
Author: Howell, James Ford
Publication info: The University of Arizona, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10287968.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation focuses on a paradigm shift that is taking place within the field of cultural memory studies. Recently, several scholars from around the world have focused on the possibility of transcultural memory and the transcultural construction of meaning. My research offers a constructive addition to the current theory, namely that transcultural memory is not as broad and universal as many understand. To support this argument, I have taken the Alexander von Humboldt reception history within the United States and Germany to demonstrate that transcultural memory coalesces around specific memory sites that are mutually constructed among cultures for a common purpose. I show that in the years following German reunification, the U.S.-American and German textual representation, use, and understanding of Alexander von Humboldt have come to be practically identical. I go on to posit that it is in such specific instances that transcultural memory is created, and not through a supposedly universal and transnational remembrance of historical events. My research clarifies certain concepts and elements regarding the turn to the transcultural in recent memory studies in that it demands a much more specific and concrete understanding of the processes at work in meaning making in an interconnected and globalized world. In order to show such a shared transcultural understanding, I have collected and studied all published materials regarding Alexander von Humboldt in the United States and Germany since the year 1990. In this way, my dissertation serves not only to support my central thesis regarding the constitution of transcultural memory, it also functions as a detailed textual survey of Humboldt within the two cultures over the last twenty-five years.

Collaborating with the Enemy: Wartime Analyses of Nazi Germany
Author: Ponten, Frederic
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10284826.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: My dissertation, entitled Collaborating with the Enemy: Wartime Analyses of Nazi Germany, is the first in-depth study of 1940s interdisciplinary literature on the Nazi German enemy produced in the United States. As a basic assumption, I suggest that the collaboration between European émigrés and American scholars was a particularly productive moment in the history of the humanities and social sciences and had a transformative effect on US-American academic culture. Accordingly, I show in three detailed case studies how various authors, intellectuals, and social scientists worked in changing settings to deal, in their writing, with the German threat. The texts generated in this historical moment not only served as theoretical contributions; some of them were able to exert an immediate, real-world impact with consequences that last until today. At the same time, I argue, these applied studies were of major importance for the postwar reformation of the humanities and social sciences and significantly shaped the intellectual landscape in the United States. Analyzing the vast amount of texts and materials produced during World War II, my dissertation claims that the literary specificity of these collaborations that shaped the wartime discourse on Nazi Germany is best understood by focusing on the new uses of concepts and practices that the scholars’ respective disciplines and professions provided, such as legal bureaucracy, humanist bookishness and anthropological observation. This focus on analytic concepts and practices provides the link between the incommensurable and contingent biographies and careers of individual researchers, and the social constitution of their collaborative research within and between various institutions, such as the Office of Strategic Services, the Library of Congress and the Museum of Modern Art Film Library. The broad range of disciplines involved is therefore not the result of an additive procedure but should be indicative of a problem-oriented approach. My dissertation contributes especially to the historiography of German literature and the epoch of exile literature, but also to intellectual, institutional and political history, and to the history of various disciplines and fields such as sociology, folklore studies, history of ideas, film studies, media studies, social psychology, and cultural anthropology.

Bestselling Borders: The Mutual Implications of German and Polish Identity in the Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Novel
Author: Kenison, Christine M.
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10267422.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation argues that engagement with the borderland in German and Polish novels of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries is grounded in recognition of the productive space engendered by the ambivalence and ambiguity of liminal spaces. This project explores how novels use those in-between spaces to construct new identities amidst social upheaval to buttress paternalistic structures to counter modernity’s corrosion of interpersonal relationships.
The dissertation analyzes four novels popular with their contemporary audiences and composed by renowned authors who demonstrated sustained interest in German-Polish literary relations. Chapter I examines the role of Polishness in policing the boundaries of a nascent German bourgeois identity in Gustav Freytag’s Soll und Haben [Debit and Credit] (1855). Chapter II treats Theodor Fontane’s 1878 historical novel, Vor dem Sturm [Before the Storm], where the staging of multiple spheres of German identity formation reveals the paradoxical nature of identity itself. Chapter III explores how Clara Viebig’s Das schlafende Heer [The Sleeping Army] (1904) appropriates the Ostmarkenroman genre to imagine a culturally unified Germany. Chapter IV examines how Bolesław Prus’ Placówka [The Outpost] (1886) illustrates the importance of coming to terms with ambiguity and ambivalence within one Polish village.
This project joins a growing scholarly dialogue on the German-Polish borderland as a space in which to reimagine the building blocks of community. The scholarship of Maria Wojtczak, Kristin Kopp, Izabela Surynt, and Hubert Orłowski has been formative in this project’s discussion of the German literary imaginary of the East. Unlike these works, my analysis encompasses both German and Polish novels, advocating for literary border studies which transcend national traditions. This project avoids elevating one literary discourse to speaker and the other to silent receptacle. Ultimately, this dissertation represents an interpretive experiment which hosts a multifaceted symposium on a shared creative space. My analysis of these novels’ engagement with the German-Polish borderland demonstrates that literature provides an alternative philosophy of ambivalence and ambiguity.

Murderous Mothers: Feminist Violence in German Literature and Film (1970-2000)
Author: Scott, Claire E.
Publication info: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10267585.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation analyzes literary and filmic representations of violent mothers from late 20th-century Germany. It employs feminist theories of language and theories of the voice and the body in film to enhance close readings of texts in which female protagonists defy gendered expectations by perpetrating acts of aggression. Through an interplay between thematic violence and the transgression of aesthetic conventions, these works generate an imaginary of feminist violence that advances feminist politics. Highlighting this dynamic reveals female bodies and voices as important sites for working through both past and contemporary violence in the German context. In addition, this work has broader theoretical significance as an intermediary between feminist theories of language and materialist feminist theories. Instead of strategies for emancipation, these texts generate female subjectivities that are engaged, not in assertions of individuality, but in collective and collaborative storytelling practices.
The first chapter considers Dea Loher’s Manhattan Medea (1999) and Christa Wolf’s Medea. Stimmen (1996). Both of these texts use the story of Medea to come to terms with a historical context in which the voices of outsiders are excluded. To counteract repetitive mythmaking, these texts push the formal boundaries of genre, advocating for heterogeneous storytelling in which more than one voice is expressed.
The second chapter analyzes Elfriede Jelinek’s Lust (1989) in terms of pornographic and melodramatic tropes. By contrasting pornography (with its emphasis on fulfilled desire) and melodrama (with its emphasis on thwarted desire), Jelinek confronts the inescapable violence in even the most intimate human relationships.
The third chapter discusses Margarethe von Trotta’s film about the militant violence of the Red Army Faction, Die bleierne Zeit (1981). By highlighting this film’s engagement with the mythological story of Antigone, this chapter demonstrates how the sisters in the film engage in collaborative mothering and memory work.
The final chapter brings together R.W. Fassbinder’s Martha (1974) and Helma Sanders-Brahms’s Deutschland, bleiche Mutter (1980). The protagonists of both films are drawn into cycles of domestic violence that leave them paralyzed and prone to acts of self harm, thereby alerting viewers to the ways in which they have uncritically accepted narratives about gender, history, and marriage.

Else Lasker-Schüler's Collaborative Avant Garde: Text &amp; Image in Berlin c. 1910
Author: Ingalls, Jennifer Cashman
Publication info: University of California, Berkeley, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10265498.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Between 1910–1914, the German poet Else Lasker-Schüler formed her infamous alter ego, Prinz Jussuf von Theben, in her frequent publications in the expressionist periodicals Der Sturm and Die Aktion. The publishing opportunities in these periodicals allowed Lasker-Schüler the space to explore genre conventions and to begin including her own graphic art. Central to Lasker-Schüler’s creation of Prinz Jussuf and her increasing incorporation of visual art, were her unsuccessful and successful collaborations with Oskar Kokoschka and Franz Marc. The texts published in the two periodicals ranged from short theater, book, and art gallery reviews to her poetry and two epistolary novels. In Der Sturm, Lasker-Schüler serially published Briefe nach Norwegen, a series of letters written to her husband and Der Sturm editor Herwarth Walden on his two-week trip to Scandinavia. The letters were published over nine months and chronicle life in bohemian circles in Berlin, merging Lasker-Schüler’s emerging fantasy world into her artistic practice. Later published as Mein Herz, the letters have previously only been analyzed within the context of this later novelization and never within their original context of a weekly periodical. By analyzing the texts within their original context, check by jowl with other texts, illustrations, and advertisements, Lasker-Schüler’s idiosyncratic engagement with contemporary life in Berlin is brought into high relief. Lasker-Schüler’s second epistolary novel was published in Der Sturm’s competitor, Die Aktion, after Lasker-Schüler’s divorce from Walden. Briefe und Bilder was addressed to Franz and Maria Marc, and corresponds to a rich private correspondence between Lasker-Schüler and the Marcs. In Briefe und Bilder, Lasker-Schüler incorporates her emerging Kingdom of Thebes, and regularly references her simultaneous private correspondence with Marc, confusing and blending the boundaries between public and private, as well as the real and the fantastic. Later published after Franz Marc’s 1916 death at Verdun in an expanded form as Der Malik, Lasker-Schüler’s text in its Briefe und Bilder form has been ignored in existing scholarship. Utilizing biography and historiography to responsibly read these texts, this dissertation approaches Lasker-Schüler’s frequent publications in weekly periodicals to understand how her identity as Prinz Jussuf von Theben was formed in the public sphere and how her multimedia practice emerged.

Abstract: This study explores a method of examining student motivation and identity in the foreign language classroom that is novel yet also complements current theories, such as those put forth by Norton and Dörnyei. It specifically examines learners’ personal connections with speakers of German, the German language, and affiliated cultures and compares the number and types of reported connections with learners’ perceptions of and affective responses to the classroom community. The different kinds of connections that students reported were sorted into Categories of Connection (CoC). These CoC were examined in conjunction with students’ sense of classroom community, classroom anxiety, self-reported behaviors in the classroom, and adjectives that students chose to describe their feelings in the classroom and the classroom atmosphere. Results from the present study showed that all of the 57 students in the present study reported at least one connection to German, most commonly (over 82% of participants) the connection Ancestry/Family. What is more, the number and types of CoC reported by students interacted with how they situated themselves in the classroom community, both in terms of how strong they believed the classroom community to be and the amount of anxiety that they felt in class. Additionally, the sense of classroom community and anxiety level in the classroom were clearly correlated among participants in this study. Participants in this study felt that the classroom community provided a positive environment, but not all of them felt equally positive about their individual roles in it. Not all types of CoC seemed to interact in the same way with the students’ experiences in class.
Results also suggest that the following areas warrant further investigation: (1) The role that CoCs play in students’ initial motivation to choose to study a specific language (here, German); (2) the degree to which students perceived to possess certain connections; and (3) the appearance and disappearance of CoCs across the course of a student’s language study. Implications for teaching center around awareness-raising activities and community building, including how teachers can encourage the development of CoCs.

The Manga Boom: The Recent Fairy-Tale Transculturation Between Germany and East Asia
Author: Gagum, Kyung Lee
Publication info: The University of Arizona, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10275168.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: This dissertation critically investigates how German culture is transculturated in Japan and in South Korea and then reproduced in a new form of manga/manhwa. These visual representations are evidence of a long history of German literary transculturation amid Japanese and Korean reading culture. Beginning with moral education materials in the 1880s, I trace the widespread reception of Grimms’ fairy tales in East Asia and argue that the success of the translations of the tales was due to the particularly successful fusion of Confucian values with the Western story form. German literature first entered the Japanese reading culture through the Grimms’ fairytales as a moral education tool. The reading reception shifted from educational space to private space and Japanese reader began to enjoy the Grimms’ fairytales outside of the classroom, which contributed to the spread of German literature. This led to a veritable Grimm boom at the end of the twentieth century, including a corpus of critical analysis by Asian scholars and fairy tale retellings from feminist perspectives that creatively fuse ideas of East and West. The globalization of manga, in turn, contributed to the scholarly discourse in the West, which nourished a rethinking and redeployment of complex borrowing practices between Asian and German literatures. From the impact of Grimms’ fairy tales, I trace the reception of the German literature in the Japanese pop literature medium manga and analyze Grimms Manga by the Japanese manga artist Kei Isiyama. Grimms’ fairy tales paved the way for the entry of German literature and I investigate Yoko Tawada’s works, who writes in Japanese and in German and incorporates fairy tale tropes and the legacy of German romanticism in the age of transnational globalization through her visual descriptive writing. I examine the Japanese author Kouhei Kadono, whose works, I claim, display the romantic themes of the German Romantics and Richard Wagner’s nationalistic ideological views of societal changes. I then shift from German literature’ influence in Japan to South Korea and I juxtapose the manhwa The Tarot Café with Goethe’s Faust to investigate gender roles. After displaying German transculturation in the selected works, I argue that manga contributes to the German classroom as part of a multiliteracies framework in a collegiate language classroom.

Writing as a "continuation of war by other means": Ernst Juenger in Weimar Germany
Author: Ackermann, Clemens B.
Publication info: Northwestern University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10259036.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: In December 1928, Ernst Jünger wrote to his brother Friedrich Georg: “Wir müssen uns […] bemühen, die literarische Tätigkeit als Kriegsmittel zu betrachten.” This project analyzes the result of said activity: viz. text understood as a means of war. That is to say, it does not aim at answering questions regarding Jünger’s political stance as it is mostly the case with scholarly literature on the subject matter at hand, but instead, it addresses a lacuna in the relevant scholarship by systematically examining the textual material as a subversive means of action that allows Jünger for the continuation of war. The examination at hand therfore begins with an analysis of Jünger’s Kriegstagebuch, in order to fathom the basis on which he will translate, transform, and instrumentalize the “Sprache der Materialschlacht” as a literary means of expression. Subsequently, it turns to the textual strategies that Jünger employs in his literature, which ought to facilitate the initiation of those who did not directly participate in the Great War to the circle of the ‘Frontsoldaten.’ Following this, the analysis of his Politische Publizistik shows that Jünger is continuously striving for a dynamic modern nationalism that always already aims at protruding beyond the borders of the state. And lastly, an examination of Der Arbeiter will show that Jünger conceptually dissolves those borders, by heralding the planetary era of the worker based on a new concept of language that stems from the material itself, which not least marks the moment when he turns his back on nationalism(s) in favor of the planetary. In each of these steps, I argue that Jünger bases his elaborations on the language of the “Material(schlacht)” instead of succumbing to the stipulated rhetoric from the realm of politics, which not only shows how he aims at perpetually waging war against the political status quo, but also that it is impossible to place him on a political map or even to tell what exactly his politics are.

Rough surfaces The collage works of Rolf Dieter Brinkmann
Author: Ewing, Megan M.
Publication info: Princeton University, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2017. 10242384.
ProQuest document link
Abstract: Rough Surfaces examines the post-1970 works of the West German author and collage artist, Rolf Dieter Brinkmann (1940–1975) Around 1970, Brinkmann’s commitment to intermedial experimentation produces a broad critique of contemporary media decrying 1) the loss of sensuous particularity, and 2) the marginalization of forms of experience that operate outside of language. These forms of experience do not contribute to a distanced perceptual mastery over one’s environs, but instead establish the fact of the body’s extra-/para-/a-linguistic communication with other objects and bodies. The dissertation investigates the potential of the post-1970 collage works to draw their reader out of the state of diminished sensory-affective experience they themselves index. All posthumously published, these are: Rom, Blicke (1979), Erkundungen für die Präzisierung des Gefühls für einen Aufstand: Reise Zeit Magazin (Tagebuch) (1987) and Schnitte (1988). Alienation under modern urban conditions is made visible, audible, and above all, palpable to the reader through Brinkmann’s relentless register of a frenzied and repetitive excess of sensory information. Rough Surfaces identifies these texts as belonging to that class of aesthetic objects whose force-effects “touch” their viewer or reader, intending to restore affective and sensory experience to the individual living under conditions of increasing abstraction, acceleration and compression.
Chapter 1 introduces the productive resonances between contemporary affect theory and Brinkmann’s post-1970 psychophysical approach to literature. Chapter 2 builds on these resonances to demonstrate that the work is best read as non-representational. Chapter 3 establishes Brinkmann's appropriation of American aesthetic models—specifically those of New York School authors, composers and artists—for his strategies. The project then charts this influence on the psychogeographic and notational praxes that generate the collage works. Chapter 4 profiles a medial shift from Brinkmann’s pre-1970 appropriations of photographic techniques of representation to the late style’s adaptations of specifically filmic techniques that structure the work after 1970.
These praxes of remediation intend the sensuous registration of a body in space by means of a temporally-bound, i.e. embodied writing, reflecting the question that motivates them—namely, how is it possible to situate a body in space as abstraction further deepens the condition of alienation?
